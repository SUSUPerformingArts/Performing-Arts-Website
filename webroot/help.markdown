The Performing Arts Archive

Currently, information about shows and events within the Performing Arts is fragmented: It is distributed through different society websites, Facebook events and groups.

Furthermore, information on old shows and the people involved in them is hard (or impossible) to find. While Facebook groups, pages and events are fantastic ways to market a show, they are not ideal for recording and archiving information. Historical information on shows is available on some society websites (such as [TG](http://theatre.susu.org/shows.php), [Showstoppers](http://showstoppers.susu.org/Shows/showpage.php?showid=1) and [StageSoc](http://stagesoc.org.uk/shows/)), however this leads to fragmentation and even duplication of information.

The aim of the archive is to provide a centralised place for information about Performing Arts shows, aiding marketing of shows with an integrated calendar and dedicated page on the web; and create a historical archive for all shows and members.

## Concepts {#concepts}

The archive is separated into pages for societies, members, shows and venues.

## Managing your profile page {#manage-profile}

Logging into the archive is done using your iSolutions (university) password, when you log in for the first time you will be asked to link your profile with previous shows that you have been involved in. *There is currently no way to log in if you are not a current member of the university.*

You are able to add a biography and photo and select the societies you are a part of. You can only edit society membership for the current year, if you want to add older years to your profile contact the Web Officer. HTML in the bios is escaped, to add formatting to your bio please use [Markdown](#markdown).

## Managing a society page {#manage-society}

All current committee members for a society are able to edit their society’s page and add shows.

Here you are able to update the society’s description and add links to Twitter, Facebook, the society website and primary email. As with profiles, society descriptions can also be formatted using [Markdown](#markdown). This information is shown on the main website’s society’s page ([http://perform.susu.org/societies/](http://perform.susu.org/societies/)), so it is important it is up to date.

## Managing shows {#manage-shows}

If you are a current member of a committee you will be able to make shows for the societies you are on the committee for here: [http://perform.susu.org/archive/shows/add](http://perform.susu.org/archive/shows/add). After a show has been added any person who is listed as having a Production Team role (Producer, Director, Musical Director, etc) will be able to edit it.

Most fields are self explanatory, with these exceptions:

* Additional links (Facebook event, society website links, videos) should be added to the show description, this can be done using [Markdown](#markdown).

* Venues can only be selected from a drop down list, to get a new venue added please contact the Web Officer (*[web@susuperformingarts.org](mailto:web@susuperformingarts.org)*). This information can be changed later, so just put in another venue until the Web Officer has added the new one to the list.

* The checkbox to indicate that you are using ticket source automatically adds a link to the Performing Arts box office to the show's page, if you are using ticketsource but want a different link to direct visitors to when buying tickets simply uncheck this box.

* To delete dates, clear the textbox.

* You can only attribute a show to one society, for collaborative projects (such as Pure Dance) you can either choose one society or email the Web Officer and they will set up a show under a generic name (Performing Arts Dance/Music/Theatrical Societies or Performing Arts Societies). After creation the society **cannot** be changed.

## Using the pages for marketing {#marketing}

When creating shows, events are automatically added to the Performing Arts calendar ([http://perform.susu.org/calendar](http://perform.susu.org/calendar)). This is separated into a calendar for each section of the performing arts, your show will automatically be placed in the correct calendar. You can add the calendars to your personal Google Calendar (and sync to your phone) with [this](/calendar/install) link.

At some point there will be a system in place for automatically having shows featured on the Performing Arts homepage. Contact the Web Officer for more details on this.

## Markdown {#markdown}

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language that is designed to be easier to read and write than HTML. The implementation of Markdown used is [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/) Extra.

Useful resources for Markdown:

* [http://dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io) or [http://hashify.me](http://hashify.me) - A live Markdown editor, allows you to see what the page will look like when formatted, in real time.

* [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) - Markdown cheatsheet, useful to quickly work out how to add links or bold text.
