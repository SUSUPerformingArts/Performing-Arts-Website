Smart mobile devices have forever changed the way we think and interact with websites. Now you have to consider an array of things you didn’t have to worry about before, such as HiDPI graphics, UI/UX patterns, touch target sizes, gestures, and managing expectations. All the while not losing track of what’s important: Content.</p>\n<p>We’re going to discuss the influence of mobile on design, trends, and implementation methods, as well as how touch is changing our lives. As designers and developers, we can benefit from learning about how mobile is changing the way we interact with websites, and what that means for the future of UI. <a href="http://wpmtl.org/2013/04/montreal-wordpress-developer_meetup-april-23rd-2013/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://wpmtl.org/2013/04/montreal-wordpress-developer_meetup-april-23rd-2013/</a></p>\n<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/19911427" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe>\n<div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/saracannon/the-future-of-ui-how-mobile-design-is-shaping-the-web-2" title="The Future of UI - How Mobile Design is Shaping The Web 2" target="_blank">The Future of UI &#8211; How Mobile Design is Shaping The Web 2</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/saracannon" target="_blank">Sara Cannon</a></strong> </div>\n<hr />\n<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1851" alt="MTLGGbarcode1" src="http://s1.ran.ge/content/uploads/2013/04/MTLGGbarcode1-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></p>\n<p>On Thursday, April 25:</p>\n<p><strong>Font Swoon!</strong></p>\n<p>Times New Roman. Helvetica. Comic Sans. We’ve all got fonts we love to use or love to hate. Typography is one of those topics that’s easy to overlook, but when you bring it up, everyone has an opinion. Sara’s talk is not just for designers spending hours debating on the slant of a curly-quote or the perfect sans serif – it’s for anyone who’s ever typed, read, or even just stared at the screen or page. Because typography is essential to how we read, consume, convey, and process the written word and it’s BFF, design.</p>\n<p>Let’s take our relationship with web typography to the next level and crush on the latest fonts, check out some awesome CSS3 implementations, and find incredible inspiration for interaction, refinement and our next dates with negative space.

If we think about #1 philosophically from a UX point of view &#8211; the formats are action-centric. They are not passively opening up the post editor then wondering what they are going to post &#8211; they are forced to make a decision, an action, and therefore the UI they are given is tailored to this decision making for a better UX.</p>\n<p>Neither Tumblr or New Dash have a way of changing the post formats &#8211; which I think is good because they would lose all the data that they put in there to the custom modals.

They are currently passive button-like selectors with a label to the right. Dave Martin ran some user tests on the current UI and the results were <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/04/09/post-formats-usability-test-round-4/">not good</a>.</p>\n<p>I decided to do some action-centric decision-first based UI exercises to explore some options.</p>\n<h2>Decision Based Approach &#8211; Working Within the Current Menu System</h2>\n<p>The first exercise is one based on just using the current menu system.

Usually I&#8217;m not-a-fan of modals at all. They tend to be disruptive. After the new media editor launched last release, its made me re-think modals. Lightbox was so terrible and slow &#8211; but using a modal for this action kind of makes sense as you can be on any page and receive it before hitting the post editor, without another page load or coming from any add post action.

The last two I think this should be an option regardless of the approach.</p>\n<p>However, that being said, I know we are in Beta for 3.6 and the modal window approach might be a bit out of reach for this release. If I were to have a #2 I would say the greyed out post edit UI with the larger icons. approach might be viable (after the decision is made, the icons go away, post editor fades in, and the format switching is in the publish meta box.)</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I hope to get some conversation going and hear what everyone else thinks so that we can make WordPress amazing together.</p>\n<p><strong><em>update: if anyone else wants to tinker, here are my thrown together photoshop files etc s.sar.ac/071P0S3r2H2Q</p>\n<p>Update 2: Mark Jaquith is asking for feedback on the Make UI Blog <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/04/11/saracannon-has-posted-her-take-on-a-new/">http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/04/11/saracannon-has-posted-her-take-on-a-new/</a></em></strong></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://ran.ge/2013/04/11/re-thinking-wordpress-post-format-ui-an-exercise/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"27";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:51:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"Globalnews.ca Data Migration and the MSSQL to MySQL Delima";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://ran.ge/2013/03/26/globalnews-ca-data-migration-and-the-mssql-to-mysql-delima/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://ran.ge/2013/03/26/globalnews-ca-data-migration-and-the-mssql-to-mysql-delima/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Mar 2013 19:54:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Migration";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"MSSQL";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"MySQL";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ran.ge/?p=1755";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:417:"Recently Globalnews.ca made the move to WordPress and we were tasked with migrating all their data from their existing custom MSSQL-based environment to the new WordPress environment hosted with WordPress.com VIP.

We have a normal process for this kind of thing, and it goes something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a local WordPress install and get rid of the default posts, comments, and meta data.</li>\n<li>Put the clients old data into tables in the same WordPress database.</li>\n<li>Write a script that pulls the data from the old tables and uses a combination of WordPress functions and direct database queries to put it into the WordPress install.</li>\n<li>Check the data and if it&#8217;s not quite right blast out the posts, comments, and meta data and go back to step 3.</li>\n<li>When the data is exactly what we want in WordPress we use <a href="http://wp-cli.org/">wp-cli</a> to export the data in <abbr title="WordPress eXtended Rss">WXR</abbr> format, and submit those files to WordPress.com VIP.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It sounds pretty straight forward, and usually it is, with the most difficult part obviously being the script that imports the data from the old tables into WordPress. Not this time however. This time the most difficult part turned out to be step 2, putting the clients data into the same database as WordPress. The problem was that the conversion from MSSQL to MySQL was no trivial matter.</p>\n<p>Often you can use <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> to migrate data from MSSQL to MySQL, so we started by spinning up a Windows cloud server with MSSQL. We imported the data into an MSSQL database on this new server, and then we installed MySQL and the MySQL Workbench. Due to the large amount of data being converted, we ran into memory issues several times and had to resize the cloud server, but once the memory issues were under control we realized that MySQL Workbench simply could not migrate many of the tables that we needed.</p>\n<p>After many hours of digging and research, I finally found the problem. It turns out that there were a couple data types that were causing things to choke. In our case that was mostly limited to nvarchar and ntext. Why? Well because MSSQL doesn&#8217;t actually support UTF-8. What?! I know&#8230;I was surprised too, but it seems MSSQL doesn&#8217;t support the standard in character encoding. Instead it has nvarchar and ntext that don&#8217;t store as UTF-8 but offer similar output in a classic Microsoft-proprietary way.</p>\n<p>I was able to work around this limitation by creating duplicate tables for each table that contained one of these field types, using nvarchar in place of varchar and ntext in place of text. Then I ran queries to select the data from the old tables and insert it into these newly created tables.</p>\n<pre class="brush: sql; title: ; notranslate">\r\nCREATE TABLE [dbo].[ImportFixed](\r\n	[RowNum] [bigint] NULL,\r\n	[post_title] [nvarchar](200) NOT NULL, -- Previously varchar\r\n	[content_html] [ntext] NULL -- Previously text\r\n) ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGE_ON [PRIMARY]\r\nGO\r\n----------------------\r\nINSERT INTO [import].[dbo].[ImportFixed](\r\n	[RowNum],\r\n	[post_title],\r\n	[content_html]\r\n)\r\nSELECT\r\n	[RowNum],\r\n	[post_title],\r\n	[content_html]\r\nFROM [import].[dbo].[Import]\r\nGO\r\n</pre>\n<p>This then allowed MySQL Workbench to properly handle the encoding during it&#8217;s migration from MSSQL to MySQL. Even once the process is known it&#8217;s tedious and time consuming at best, but it seems to be very reliable and stable.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://ran.ge/2013/03/26/globalnews-ca-data-migration-and-the-mssql-to-mysql-delima/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"Sara Cannon to Speak at WordCamp Atlanta on Saturday";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"http://ran.ge/2013/03/12/sara-cannon-to-speak-at-wordcamp-atlanta-on-saturday/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://ran.ge/2013/03/12/sara-cannon-to-speak-at-wordcamp-atlanta-on-saturday/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Mar 2013 22:57:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Speaking";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ran.ge/?p=1684";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:375:"I&#8217;m so excited to be speaking at WordCamp Atlanta this Saturday!

I&#8217;m an idealist. Always have been. I think that I can have my cake and eat it too, without preventing anyone else from doing the same.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also a capitalist. I have no problem with people making money. I encourage people to! Making money isn&#8217;t a bad thing, although I do think there are methods of making money which are.</p>\n<p>So there you have it. I&#8217;m a strange blend. I&#8217;m an Idealistic Capitalist.</p>\n<p><a href="http://s1.ran.ge/content/uploads/2013/01/120_20.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1648" alt="120_20" src="http://s1.ran.ge/content/uploads/2013/01/120_20-300x197.jpeg" width="300" height="197" /></a>The idealist in me <strong>loves</strong> the Internet. It has brought with it freedoms that never existed before and brought opportunities to people that never had them before. Almost ten years ago a good friend of mine, <a href="http://jamesapearson.com/">James Pearson</a>, went to Nepal and worked with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabir_Pun">Mahabir Pun</a> and the <a href="http://www.nepalwireless.net/">Nepal Wireless Project</a> to bring the Internet to places that didn&#8217;t have it. I encourage you to read <a href="http://www.nepalwireless.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=53">their story</a>, but to sum it up they hiked through the Himalayas putting up antennas to relay a wireless network out to small villages. The benefit to the schools in the area was enormous. Can you imagine having access to the information on the internet when previously you were a day or more walk from the nearest city? Think about how that increased the quality of education! Think about how they could leverage that to actually fund their school and get supplies they needed! This is the Internet I love. This is the Internet I want to protect.</p>\n<p>The thing about that whole story is that the truly transformative part, the inspiring part, was all about the users. It&#8217;s the people in the villages, the teachers, the students.

We&#8217;d like to see an actual lockout with a &#8220;click to takeover&#8221; option, as well as an indicator in the posts list which posts are currently locked</li>\n<li>Better post format UI in admin &#8211; So users can better tell what post formats do/what they&#8217;re for</li>\n<li>Twenty Thirteen &#8211; The new default theme, which will hopefully highlight the functionality of post formats</li>\n<li>Editorial flow &#8211; Allow post updates to be submitted for review</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently everything in still in flux and some things might get cut, re-prioritized, or added, but this is already shaping up to be an amazing release!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"http://ran.ge/2013/01/03/ranger-becomes-wordpress-3-6-co-lead/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:72:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Responsive Web Design Resources";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"http://ran.ge/2012/12/06/responsive-web-design-resources/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://ran.ge/2012/12/06/responsive-web-design-resources/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 07 Dec 2012 03:27:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:11:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Design";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Resources";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Grid frameworks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"links";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Media Queries";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"resources";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Responsive Design";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:7;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Responsive Images";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:8;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"Responsive Video";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:9;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"responsive web design";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:10;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"Retina/HiDPI screens";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ran.ge/?p=1560";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:404:"Presentations: Sara Cannon at Future Insights Live &#8211; slides Sara Cannon in WCSF 2011 &#8211; video / slides Grid frameworks: A List Apart: Fluid Grids by Ethan Marcotte.

In making <a href="http://NonstopAdvocates.com">NonstopAdvocates.com</a> we saw the use-case for parallax scrolling: to tell their philanthropic story. We also needed the website to be extremely mobile friendly as the campaign spreads around social media. How can we get the best of both worlds?  Well, we decided that we would fight the uphill battle and sort this problem out once and for all.</p>\n<h2>The Parallax</h2>\n<p>I have <a href="http://www.nikebetterworld.com/">always</a> / <a href="http://www.cantilever-chippy.co.uk/">loved</a> / <a href="http://benthebodyguard.com/index.php">parallax</a> / <a href="http://lostworldsfairs.com/atlantis/">sites</a>.  I dreamed of finding a client who the<a href="http://www.dangersoffracking.com/"> story-telling </a>aspect would be perfect for. Its almost like directing a video. You write it like a script and play it out: the graphical and storyline interactions. The code part of this comes later. Thinking about the story you have to tell is the best place to start.</p>\n<p>As for the code: we used <a href="https://github.com/richardshepherd/Parallax-Scrolling">Richard Shephard&#8217;s JS / CSS</a> on Github as our desktop parallax base. It looks great! But what about mobile? I pulled out all the tiny tablet-y devices and to my surprise the parallax kinda worked &#8211; but it had one major flaw: it was slow and choppy and needed to simmer down and become sleek and sexy like the desktop.</p>\n<p>Luckily for us* we were already using <a href="http://underscores.me/">_s</a> for our theme base with <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">foundation</a> to help with the responsive bits. Minus the parallax sludge, mobile was already in a good place with some tweaking (like un-sticking the sticky navigation, etc). Now the question is being begged:</p>\n<h2>How do we disable and modify the parallax to speed up the site on mobile and tablets?</h2>\n<p>Enter<a href="http://jetpack.me"> Jetpack</a> by Automattic! They have a nifty mobile detection system built right in that we can utilize. We leveraged it to disable the parallax JavaScript and load in an extra CSS file when tablet or mobile is detected. In that stylesheet we were able to load in smaller compiled versions of multiple background images, and utilize media queries to adjust them at different sizes.</p>\n<p><strong>Utilizing Jetpack:</strong></p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\r\nfunction range_is_mobile_or_tablet() {\r\n	if ( class_exists( ''Jetpack_User_Agent_Info'' ) ) {\r\n		$ua_info = new Jetpack_User_Agent_Info();\r\n		return ( jetpack_is_mobile() || $ua_info-&gt;is_tablet() );\r\n	}\r\n	return false;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Disabling js and loading in the CSS:</strong></p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\r\nif ( ! range_is_mobile_or_tablet() )\r\n	wp_enqueue_script( ''parallax'', get_template_directory_uri() . ''/js/parallax.js'', array( ''jquery'' ), ''20121114'' );\r\nelse\r\n	wp_enqueue_style( ''tabletmobilecss'', get_template_directory_uri() . &quot;/parallaxdisabled.css&quot;, array( ''style'' ), ''3.1.4'' );\r\n</pre>\n<p>Now that the css is loading in , we can begin to start the tedious finagling and image resizing process until perfection is achieved. But what is the secret to the sauce? <strong>We can also use that handy function range_is_mobile_or_tablet() to target our php in our theme files if we so desired.</strong></p>\n<p>You&#8217;re now thinking: &#8220;WHAT? REALLY? MODIFY THE THEME FILES BUT IM SO USED TO RESPONSIVE DESIGN WHERE YOU JUST SHIFT THINGS AROUND OR HIDE THINGS!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad you had a little freak out there because I did too when I realized that I had<strong> ALL THE POWER TO MODIFY ANYTHING</strong>. But caution: power can be dangerous and evil (like if you put in so many conditionals on content that you can&#8217;t keep up with modifications). Use sparingly.</p>\n<p><a href="http://s1.ran.ge/content/uploads/2012/12/nonstop2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1553" alt="" src="http://s1.ran.ge/content/uploads/2012/12/nonstop2.jpg" height="772" width="916" /></a><a href="http://s1.ran.ge/content/uploads/2012/12/nonstop3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1552" alt="" src="http://s1.ran.ge/content/uploads/2012/12/nonstop3.jpg" height="772" width="916" /></a><a href="http://s1.ran.ge/content/uploads/2012/12/nonstop4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1551" alt="" src="http://s1.ran.ge/content/uploads/2012/12/nonstop4.jpg" height="772" width="916" /></a>*actually this was planned because we&#8217;re genius</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"http://ran.ge/2012/12/05/parallax-and-mobile/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:19:"http://ran.ge/feed/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:11:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Wed, 15 May 2013 09:32:43 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=UTF-8";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";a:2:{i:0;s:15:"Accept-Encoding";i:1;s:6:"Cookie";}s:13:"cache-control";s:28:"max-age=166, must-revalidate";s:12:"x-powered-by";s:21:"PHP/5.4.14-1~dotdeb.1";s:10:"x-pingback";s:27:"http://ran.ge/wp/xmlrpc.php";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Wed, 08 May 2013 19:11:22 GMT";s:4:"etag";s:34:""8f4f54aa40d9749e13e1a2584c48eff7"";s:4:"node";s:20:"web11.dfw.wphost.com";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130307140136";}', 'no');

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies">sponsorship information</a><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' />  )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/summer-mentorship-programs-gsoc-and-gnome/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:51:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"WordPress 10th Anniversary Tees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 16:40:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Events";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Store";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"swag";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"wp10";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2561";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:338:"In honor of the upcoming 10th anniversary celebrations, we&#8217;ve put a special 10th anniversary tshirt in the swag store at cost &#8212; $10 per shirt plus shipping.

Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave: </strong> Posts are now autosaved locally.

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/">3.4</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="http://webos.wordpress.org/">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">core</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">forum support</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/updates/">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href="http://sopastrike.com/numbers/">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="692" height="388" title="Introducing WordPress 3.5" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

Having articles linked within the Dashboard is not only a big responsibility, but it has opened the flood gates to the different types of people accessing the content presented on this site from across the world. Through referrer links, I&#8217;ve been able to discover so many different websites thanks to people clinking the links from within their dashboard. WPTavern.com is like a giant megaphone that when used correctly, becomes a wonderful thing. </p>\n<p>In the near future, WPTavern will become an authoritative website. It&#8217;s not about publishing 100 articles a day, but publishing content that is interesting and, providing research/back story to that content. I like to think of WPTavern as an ongoing diary as to what is happening within the world of WordPress. However I&#8217;m opening up this diary/platform to the community. There will be caveats of course such as all content passes before me before it&#8217;s published. Guest authors will receive a Contributor level account to make things easier for the author to manage their posts. </p>\n<p>If you look around, you&#8217;ll notice that there are no ads on this site. WPTavern.com is not about generating revenue. It&#8217;s about becoming the second largest WordPress community of users and enthusiasts on the web. Of course, the first is WordPress.org itself but the long-term goal for this site is to become an alternative community with an integral bridge to the WordPress project. WordPress.org is not right for everyone whether it be the attitude of people, the atmosphere, or any number of reasons which is why having another place to go is beneficial. In the early days of WPTavern, this website was on pace to become one of the largest parts of the WordPress community with a bustling commenting section, an active forum, and all sorts of different interactions taking place that at times, influenced some of the decisions that were made with the core of WordPress. </p>\n<p>There were plenty of times in the past where members of the WPTavern community tried to nominate me to become some sort of WordPress.org community liaison or an employee of Automattic. With the relaunch of WPTavern, I am now in the position at least with this domain to become that community liaison. In the near future, this site will be sporting a new design, bbPress and finally, run BuddyPress. A tavern is a place where people gather to talk and have a good time which is exactly the kind of atmosphere I&#8217;ll be promoting here.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in contributing an article to this site, please get in touch with me via the contact form or through twitter @WPTavern.</p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wptavern-watering-hole-still-open-for-business" rel="bookmark" title="WPTavern Watering Hole Still Open For Business">WPTavern Watering Hole Still Open For Business</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/welcome-to-the-wordpress-tavern" rel="bookmark" title="Welcome To The WordPress Tavern">Welcome To The WordPress Tavern</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-org-should-scare-you" rel="bookmark" title="WordPress.org Should Scare You">WordPress.org Should Scare You</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/3_--Ndj2CdU" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 13 May 2013 20:14:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"Akismet: University Site on WordPress?

I thought it sounded like a cool idea so I got in touch with James Lane, one of the founders behind the site to ask him what it&#8217;s all about. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: First off, can you explain what ExperimentWith is?</em></strong></p>\n<p>ExperimentWith.com was started as a testing site for our clients sites while we develop them. It had a nice ring to it and it allowed us to host testing on a separate but not local server. It also allowed for testing in an MU environment. But as we ran into more and more issues with plugins that were never tested on an MU environment so we allowed some authors to test and helped debug a few plugins so we can use them for client projects. After a few projects, we discussed it would be nice to open up our MU based site to who ever wants to use it for testing, debugging or whatever for projects for the community. That was two months ago.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: What is going on behind the scenes of ExperimentWith.com and what software or hardware are you using to offer this service?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Behind the scenes its a WordPress MU site running on one of our business class hosting accounts with access to ruby and sass for testing WordPress plugins and themes. Its hosted off our MidPhase account although we have moved most of our site to BlueHost, RackSpace, or ZippyKid. We purchased five years of hosting from MidPhase and said what the hell, lets make it useful and if it becomes popular then we can keep it running.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: Is ExperimentWith exclusively tailored for WordPress testing?</em></strong></p>\n<p>We are tailored for WordPress testing but our server has elements running on it to allow for other WordPress integrations like Ruby, SASS, node.js, ect. We like experimenting with other projects out there to see how they can improve, on client specific projects.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: It looks like the site is not yet open to the public, do you have a firm date in mind as to when that will happen?</em></strong></p>\n<p>As for going public, we decided to initially start it up as an email us for about your project and if we like it and it won&#8217;t cause the end of the world or WordPress as we know it we will give you access. We never thought that more than a few people may take interest in it or would need the resources. So not to dance around your question but Experiment With is a very dynamic project and we are open to help develop it to whatever the community needs.</p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-2-8-1-beta-by-end-of-the-week" rel="bookmark" title="WordPress 2.8.1 Beta By End Of The Week">WordPress 2.8.1 Beta By End Of The Week</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/tbItUVd3scc" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 13 May 2013 15:27:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"WPTavern: MP6 Is Like Eye Candy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6886";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/qPSAnt3ynuw/mp6-is-like-eye-candy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6644:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mp6logo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6888" alt="mp6 plugin header logo" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mp6logo.jpg?resize=206%2C197" /></a>I&#8217;ve taken the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mp6/">MP6 plugin</a> for a test drive and so far, my eyes love what they see. MP6 is an experimental plugin for testing out new ideas for the various UI elements that are within WordPress. My first reaction after activating the plugin was, <strong>WOW</strong>. The textual elements on the screen instantly became easier to read. The icons along with the colors of the left navigational menu were more pronounced and the post writing screen becomes easier to use. I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that I recognized some similarities between what was in MP6 versus the <a href="http://fortysevenrobots.com/wordpress/fluency-admin/">Fluency Administration theme</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple of comparison screenshots between MP6 and Fluency.</p>\n<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/mp6-is-like-eye-candy#gallery-6886-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<p>Personally, I like MP6 better than Fluency but I wanted to bring all of this up because back in 2007, <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/">WordPress 2.7 &#8220;Coltrane&#8221;</a> was released and its major feature was the user interface overhaul. In April of 2009, a <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2009/04/poll-results/">poll was conducted</a> on WordPress.org where users voted for which design tweak they liked most. While the dark Fluency style contained the most votes, the conclusion of the poll was that overall, a darker color scheme was preferred. </p>\n<div id="attachment_6927" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DesignPollResults.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DesignPollResults.jpg?resize=500%2C177" alt="2009 Poll Results" class="size-large wp-image-6927" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Poll Results From 2009</p></div>\n<p>I reached out to Matt Thomas, one of the driving forces behind the MP6 plugin to ask him about these similarities between MP6 and Fluency as well as what the future might hold for MP6 items reaching the core of WordPress. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: Regarding the style and design of MP6. Were there any inspirations taken from the Fluency admin theme? Back in 2009, there was a poll conducted on possible design Tweaks and the dark Fluency theme beat every other alternative in the poll <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2009/04/poll-results/">http://wordpress.org/news/2009/04/poll-results/</a> and when I checked out MP6 today, it looked similar in ways, in others not so much.</p>\n<p>Also, MP6 is an ongoing experiment but is its links tied back to that poll, knowing full well that there was definitely an audience that would love to see a darker back-end?</strong></em></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s almost nothing we haven&#8217;t looked at in finding inspiration for MP6. Medium, Readmill, Twitter, Squarespace, Simple.com, we&#8217;ve got a vast collection of bits and pieces of UI that have inspired pieces of what you see in MP6. We didn&#8217;t directly rely on that survey or the comments from that development cycle, considering how much has changed since that time. But I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the Fluency plugin, though I never used it much since I blog on WordPress.com. It inspired my submissions to that 2.8 redesign discussion you mentioned, as well. And we were very glad to see that Dean is following the progress of MP6 and likes where it&#8217;s headed. <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/03/15/mp6-version-0-3/#comment-22786">http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/03/15/mp6-version-0-3/#comment-22786</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: While testing Fluency, it&#8217;s only compatible with WordPress 3.2. Keeping up with WordPress through the administration theme has to be tough work. Are there plans to keep this plugin updated along side WordPress for the foreseeable future or even perhaps add it to core as an option people could choose within their profile?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Definitely, it&#8217;s difficult to keep our development coördinated with trunk just in the course of a single development cycle. Based on my preliminary conversations with Mark J and Nacin, I expect we&#8217;ll hand over MP6 to the core team around the beginning of the 3.7 development cycle to begin its implementation into core.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: Last but not least did Dean J. Robinson contribute to anything in MP6?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Didn&#8217;t contribute directly, but see above for the generous feedback he gave us.</p>\n<p>Four years ago, users showed their support of a darker toned WordPress administration area. Is it no surprise then that <a href="http://macmanx.com/2013/04/19/the-future-wordpress-dashboard-on-wordpress-com/">so</a> <a href="http://www.doitwithwp.com/the-new-wordpress-dashboard-design-mp6-try-it-now/">many people</a> <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/mp6?filter=5">are loving the way</a> the back-end looks with MP6 installed? After going through major interface design changes in WordPress 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, and witnessing the frustration by fellow users, I commend the WordPress team on their new approach to design changes through a plugin versus outright putting it on our plates with a new release. In this way, we can avoid drastic interface changes from one release to the next and instead, use the plugin as a continual testing ground for enhancements. </p>\n<p>To those who are using MP6, what are your thoughts? Would you like to see what&#8217;s presented within MP6 to be the next design iteration of the WordPress back-end or are you content with the current grey-blue color scheme?</p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/the-header-wont-be-changing-in-28" rel="bookmark" title="The Header Won&#8217;t Be Changing In 2.8">The Header Won&#8217;t Be Changing In 2.8</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/vote-for-the-new-header-design" rel="bookmark" title="Vote For The New Header Design">Vote For The New Header Design</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/basic-guide-on-creating-plugin-ui" rel="bookmark" title="Basic Guide On Creating Plugin UI">Basic Guide On Creating Plugin UI</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/qPSAnt3ynuw" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 13 May 2013 14:52:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"WordPress.tv: Francesco Marzoli: Best Practice per Esportare la Grafica PSD ottimizzata per un Tema WP";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=17337";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:119:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/12/francesco-marzoli-best-practice-per-esportare-la-grafica-psd-ottimizzata-per-un-tema-wp/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:760:"<div id="v-gGIPWY7i-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/17337/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/17337/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=17337&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/12/francesco-marzoli-best-practice-per-esportare-la-grafica-psd-ottimizzata-per-un-tema-wp/"><img alt="Francesco Marzoli: Best Practice per Esportare la Grafica PSD ottimizzata per un Tema WP" src="http://videos.videopress.com/gGIPWY7i/video-cee3c531d3_scruberthumbnail_3.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 12 May 2013 15:00:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WordPress.tv: Luca Mascaro: UX mix – come creare un’esperienza d’uso eccellente";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=17339";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/12/luca-mascaro-ux-mix-come-creare-unesperienza-duso-eccellente/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:720:"<div id="v-d9OF9nvK-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/17339/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/17339/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=17339&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/12/luca-mascaro-ux-mix-come-creare-unesperienza-duso-eccellente/"><img alt="Luca Mascaro: UX mix &#8211;

Articles like these pop up from time to time because the WordPress project is ever-evolving. Just a few years ago, contributing to the WordPress project outside of writing code was not as straightforward as it could have been. Within the past 2 years, a lot has changed and now, UI people, designers, writers, testers, can all contribute their small part in an easy, structured way thanks to the various <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.WordPress</a> blogs. Those that are passionate about writing now have the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/handbooks/">community driven handbooks</a> to contribute to. Those that are passionate about the mobile publishing experience can get involved with the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/mobile/">mobile team</a>. It&#8217;s great to see the project branch out to make it as easy as possible to get as many different people contributing. </p>\n<blockquote><p>“Don’t ever feel that just because you don’t know how to code like Nacin and Otto that you’re not just as valuable as they are. Because without us, too, WordPress would fall apart. A healthy community is healthy on all levels, and everybody does know that.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love that quote by Mika Epstein. As for my own contributions, I&#8217;ve never written any code for WordPress or contributed any patches. However, through the WPTavern website as well as the forum, I&#8217;ve been able to contribute in various ways such as publishing information about a bug I&#8217;ve run into, thoughts and opinions on how certain things should work, addition and subtraction of features in the core, etc. In at least one instance, I published an article that complained about the fact that within the WordPress back-end, users were limited to only seeing 20 posts, comments, pages, at a time. I wanted an easy way to change that. Thanks to Peter Westwood, one of the later versions of WordPress introduced that enhancement to the Screen Options drop down tab. </p>\n<p>So at the end of the day, folks are running out of excuses as to why they can&#8217;t contribute to WordPress. </p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/terry-sutton-on-contributing-to-wordpress" rel="bookmark" title="Terry Sutton On Contributing To WordPress">Terry Sutton On Contributing To WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/community-oriented-wordpress-magazine-idea" rel="bookmark" title="Community Oriented WordPress Magazine Idea">Community Oriented WordPress Magazine Idea</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/from-the-other-side-of-the-fence-how-wordpress-won" rel="bookmark" title="From The Other Side Of The Fence &#8211; How WordPress Won">From The Other Side Of The Fence &#8211; How WordPress Won</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/hnjXHoYropo" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 10 May 2013 16:30:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"WPTavern: A VaultPress Everyone Can Afford";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6873";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/8Zci4EFfgWE/a-vaultpress-everyone-can-afford";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2168:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/vaultpress-logo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3590" alt="vaultpress logo" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/vaultpress-logo.png?resize=236%2C78" /></a>The wait is over for those that have wanted an affordable offering from VaultPress. The <a href="http://blog.vaultpress.com/2013/05/08/introducing-vaultpress-lite/">service announced</a> on May 8th that a new service level called VaultPress Lite would be available for an astoundingly cheap $5.00 per month, per site. The plan covers the basics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily backups that happen automatically, so you can focus on creating, not logistics.</li>\n<li>Automated site restores, so you can restore your entire site with a single click.</li>\n<li>Thirty days of saved backups, so you can go back in time to restore the last clean version of your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Customers also have access to their support staff as well. Since VaultPress launched, there have been a number of people who have exclaimed their jubilation of being able to easily restore their sites after a catastrophe. I bet it only takes one experience like that for VaultPress to seem like a bargain, regardless of the price. </p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a

Twitter, WordPress community member Travis Ballard @Ansimation <a href="https://twitter.com/ansimation/statuses/332124789172994049">published a link</a> to a plugin that will have people thinking twice before they sign up to a WordPress based website. Ironically, it&#8217;s called <a href="http://gangstercode.com/wpevil-series-text-passwords-plugin/">WPEvil</a> and saves passwords into plain text instead of hashes. One thing I&#8217;ve learned over the years is that passwords are to never be stored in plain text, for any reason. I reached out to the creators of this plugin to see if they could give me a couple of legitimate use cases. Here is what they had to say.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Legitimate use would be I guess to tell one of your users their password if they can&#8217;t reset it for some reason. There are no appropriate uses for this plugin, I guess you could do your own research to see what people actually use as passwords.</p>\n<p>Motivation? Bored.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Travis also <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1dxfop/wpevil_series_text_passwords_plugin_spy_on_your/">got in touch with the plugin author on Reddit</a> to discuss legitimate uses for this plugin and was greeted with an insult that it was above his pay grade.</p>\n<p>So if you come across a WordPress powered website that you can tell is using this plugin, would you register your account there? How does it make you feel to see a company release such a plugin to the wild? Should anyone be worried that this plugin exists? </p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-plugin-authors-the-target-of-a-phishing-scam" rel="bookmark" title="WP Plugin Authors The Target Of A Phishing Scam">WP Plugin Authors The Target Of A Phishing Scam</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/absolute-privacy-plugin-now-at-v1-2" rel="bookmark" title="Absolute Privacy Plugin Now At v1.2">Absolute Privacy Plugin Now At v1.2</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/whats-the-best-way-to-be-notified-of-theme-and-plugin-updates" rel="bookmark" title="What&#8217;s The Best Way To Be Notified Of Theme And Plugin Updates?">What&#8217;s The Best Way To Be Notified Of Theme And Plugin Updates?</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/1om4I3Pxd9A" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 May 2013 22:01:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"WPTavern: Up To The Community To Improve Theme Demo Data";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6835";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/1k3l_kCn-Rk/up-to-the-community-to-improve-theme-demo-data";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3393:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/PostStatusLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/PostStatusLogo.jpg?resize=218%2C51" alt="Post Status Logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6860" /></a>Brian Krogsgard of Poststat.us has <a href="http://poststat.us/wordpress-org-theme-demos-leave-a-lot-to-be-desired/">raised an issue</a> that I never considered concerning the demo content displayed within themes on the theme repository. While commercial theme demos do a great job showing off what a theme is capable of doing, for at least some themes on the repository, the demo content ruins the look of a theme. As Brian pointed out, look at <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/pinboard">Pinboard</a> as an example. Looks great in the screenshot but is terrible using the WP.org demo content. The Pinboard theme needs to be configured with featured images and such before it can look the way it does in the screenshot. The blog demo content doesn&#8217;t suit Pinboard out of the box. </p>\n<p>This got me thinking. How many themes on WordPress.org are considered to look bad simply because of the demo content? Quite a discussion was had on Brian&#8217;s post on what could be done to solve the problem with <a href="http://poststat.us/wordpress-org-theme-demos-leave-a-lot-to-be-desired/#comment-27589">Otto responding</a> within the comments that this issue was discussed at last years WordPress Community Summit. Because of the issues involved with monitoring and such, theme authors will most likely never be able to add a custom demo link to their theme page. It&#8217;s also likely that theme authors will not be given control over the demo content displayed within the theme. However, <a href="http://poststat.us/wordpress-org-theme-demos-leave-a-lot-to-be-desired/#comment-27611">Otto has suggested</a> the following for theme authors that want better default demo data:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So, theme authors: Get together, make a site somewhere, start to put some demo data on it. Work together to create it. Argue about it. Pick fights. Whatever. ;)</p>\n<p>Come up with a good community-made set of demo data, and I assure you that I, for one, will certainly pay attention. This is something that can be easily community-driven and created. Once we have a site with the data, then it’s a simple matter of an export/import to get it onto the previewer. Well, not quite that simple, but still pretty simple.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So if anyone puts together an area to start working on this project, get in touch with me so I can pass the word. </p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/listener-poll-how-should-i-review-a-theme" rel="bookmark" title="Listener Poll: How Should I Review A Theme?">Listener Poll: How Should I Review A Theme?</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/standardizing-theme-hook-names" rel="bookmark" title="Standardizing Theme Hook Names">Standardizing Theme Hook Names</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/theme-repository-eyetracking-and-free-themes" rel="bookmark" title="Theme Repository, EyeTracking And Free Themes">Theme Repository, EyeTracking And Free Themes</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/1k3l_kCn-Rk" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 May 2013 21:04:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"WPTavern: At 10 Years Old, Is It Time To Fork?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6834";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/-cVCmpOtDqY/at-10-years-old-is-it-time-to-fork";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10428:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/designisphilosophy.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/designisphilosophy.jpg?resize=174%2C71" alt="Design Is Philosophy Logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6848" /></a>Over at Design Is Philosophy, Morten Rand-Hendriksen raised the question if after 10 years, is it <a href="http://designisphilosophy.com/wordpress/wordpress-at-10-time-for-a-fork/">time to fork WordPress</a>? The gist of the post is an argument/discussion that&#8217;s been made over the years at different times. It boils down to figuring out a way to remove all the stuff that&#8217;s not needed in WordPress and coming up with a lean, modular core. Morten takes an interesting approach in that this new WordPress would consist of branches. You start with WP Core connected to different branches that contain specific functionality such as WP CMS or WP For Bloggers. In this way, those specific use case branches would have most of what you needed out of the box without having one WordPress package that contained everything for everyone. </p>\n<p>On paper, I like the idea of a lean WordPress with modules that I enable or disable based on the functionality I need. Several years ago, I used a CMS called e107 that behaved in this manner. It was pretty cool at the time because if I wanted forums, I just enabled the forums module. If not, I left it disabled and the forums never loaded. Back in 2009, a lengthy discussion took place around the very topic of making WordPress more modular, <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-February/024242.html">Less than Core, More than Plugins/Themes: Proposing Optional Modules</a>. Unlike creating different packages or branches of WordPress to fulfill specific needs, optional plugins could offer that functionality so that it wouldn&#8217;t be stuck in core.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What I&#8217;d like to propose is the creation of a new concept for WordPress, the &#8220;Optional module.&#8221; Optional modules would be singular like the core and would be versioned with the core but they would not be included in the default installation. Optional modules would be &#8220;installed-on-demand&#8221; based on a plugin&#8217;s request and admin&#8217;s approval to install, and the version of the optional module installed would be determined by the version of the WordPress core that is installing it.</p>\n<p>Having &#8220;Optional Modules&#8221; for WordPress such as I propose would allow progress in the direction of common infrastructure without bloating the core. And one of the first such optional modules could be a basic theming framework</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the biggest arguments against the idea is that the mostly volunteer based team that works on the core of WordPress is already pressed for time, (pardon the pun) and by creating these optional modules or plugins, it would significantly raise their work load to the point where it negatively affects their ability to work on WordPress core. That discussion took place around February of 2009. In <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/canonical-plugins/">late 2009, early 2010</a> the term Canonical Plugin was created to differentiate these plugins from a normal WordPress plugin. A poll was conducted with different name choices with Core Plugins winning the top spot. At the time, a core plugin was defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Core plugins are community developed and encourage collaboration with multiple developers to satisfy the most popular functionality requests that would not make it into the Core of WordPress. These plugins would be developed alongside the core of WordPress to ensure compatibility, coding standards are met, secure code, etc. To highlight these plugins, a screen would be added to the plugins page in the back-end of WordPress to highlight these special plugins. Everything sounds great right? Let’s take a look at some of the possible unintended consequences this could have on the community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the only plugins that I know of that ended up with this Core Plugin status was called <a href="http://westi.wordpress.com/2009/12/26/giving-your-wordpress-a-check-up/">Health Check by Peter Westwood</a>. This plugin was used as a test bed for the idea of creating core plugins through collaboration. </p>\n<p>I reached out to Aaron D. Campbell as he was one of the volunteers to generate effort and focus towards the Core Plugin project and asked him a few questions about the work that&#8217;s been completed since 2010 for Core Plugins.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff -</strong> On January 11th, 2010 you published on the Make.WordPress.core blog on creating a Core Plugin Infrastructure. The only core plugin that I know up which was an experiment was Health Check by Peter Westwood. Do you know of any others that have been created since 2010? Has there been much progress or work done towards the idea of Core Plugins since?</p>\n<p><strong>Aaron -</strong>No. Post by E-Mail never really got off the ground. I&#8217;m hoping to get it kicked off at some point, possibly with a GSoC student this year (it was one of the ideas). Honestly, the best example of the CONCEPT of community driven development AROUND WordPress is probably _s. It&#8217;s a theme not a plugin, but it accomplished what we were envisioning</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff -</strong> Well, Jetpack has sort of taken the Post by email feature and put it into a plugin. My guess would be that eventually that feature will be removed in WordPress like Links in favor of the Jetpack version.</p>\n<p><strong>Aaron -</strong> I don&#8217;t think so. I don&#8217;t think any feature will ever be removed in favor of Jetpack.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff -</strong> I was under the impression that core plugins would enable WordPress to be able to take things that became not so widely used anymore and be able to put stuff like that into a plugin enabling a light nimble core. Therefor, decreasing the need to argue that WordPress is bloated and we need to fork it.</p>\n<p><strong>Aaron -</strong> That&#8217;s certainly one of the goals of core plugins. However, Jetpack is not a core plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff -</strong> So since 2010, not much work has been accomplished around the idea of Core Plugins but it&#8217;s still an idea that&#8217;s being kicked around and will possibly make headway in the future?</p>\n<p><strong>Aaron -</strong> Yep. I think almost everyone agrees it&#8217;s a good idea, but having the hours needed to actually make it happen is a whole different thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff -</strong> Agreed. It was one of the issues immediately brought up in the hackers mailing list article first proposing the idea of these core modules. Time and effort which wouldn&#8217;t detract from the time and effort of Core itself </p>\n<p>The issues that Morten has raised such as being stuck with old backwards compatibility code and future development of WordPress are justified but I don&#8217;t like the idea of different WordPress branches or cores. I don&#8217;t want to go through a process of figuring out which specific type of WordPress I need and I doubt new users will be able to easily grasp which one is best for them. We&#8217;ll end up needing flow charts, bar graphs and such to explain the differences. At the same time, I have noticed how much stuff WordPress has added over the years that I simply don&#8217;t use. Yet, the features I don&#8217;t use are the ones my neighbor does. It seems counter-productive to install plugins that remove unused functionality just so it&#8217;s completely out of my way. It also bothers me that so much of the unused portions of WordPress are loaded or even processed when they shouldn&#8217;t. This is why I&#8217;m for the idea of compartmentalizing WordPress to the point of simply being able to turn things on or off. Then again, I can see how having a module for the simple task of disabling or enabling image editing in WordPress could be cumbersome. </p>\n<p>I want to see WordPress continue on for another 10 years but at the same time, I don&#8217;t want it to bring everything from the previous 10 years with it. Although I haven&#8217;t mentioned the word bloat, this post from 2009 is relevant in that it discusses the question, <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/what-is-wordpress-bloat">What is WordPress bloat</a>? </p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ghostlogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ghostlogo.jpg?resize=313%2C135" alt="ghostlogo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6854" /></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;d be re missed if I didn&#8217;t mention <a href="http://tryghost.org/">Ghost</a> somewhere in this conversation. <a href="http://john.onolan.org/ghost/">Ghost is a vision</a> proposed by John O&#8217;Nolan that aims to get back to the roots of simple, easy, publishing. I&#8217;m excited about Ghost and joined in with the crowd of wanting to see it in action. At this point, Ghost is just a bunch of pretty screenshots but I like what I see. John started a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform">Kickstarter campaign</a> to acquire 25,000 Great British Pounds to get the project off the ground. Not only did he reach that goal within hours of starting the campaign, he has since quadrupled the goal amount with 19 days left to go. What this tells me is that there is pent-up interest in seeing a platform that gets back to the basics of publishing. Many of the names on the backers list are long-time WordPress users. </p>\n<p>There are techniques and methods to get WordPress back to its roots of being the easiest software to use to publish words to the web. Forking is not one of those methods. Are you willing to stick with WordPress through the long haul or are you ready to pack your bags and jump ship the minute something easier and better looking is released?</p>\n<div

However, as a customer, it&#8217;s difficult to find where those 100% GPL licensed themes are located on the site. Upon browsing the Themeforest Marketplace, I could not find a <em>category, tag, or link</em> that would show me all the WordPress themes licensed as such. Since the text located within the license information box is able to be crawled by Google, you can use a Site specific search query to find these themes. Just type <em>site:http://themeforest.net/item This item is licensed 100% GPL.</em> into Google to see a list of themes that have been indexed. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/themeforestGPL.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/themeforestGPL.jpg?resize=532%2C265" alt="ThemeForest GPL Search String" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6838" /></a></p>\n<p>While I saw 53,800 results listed, not all the results take you directly to the theme page. For example, the License text is also shown on the <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/hustle/discussion/4137914">discussion pages</a> for each theme which is also indexed. Until Themeforest creates a better way of browsing these specific themes, this will have to do. </p>\n<p><strong>Hat Tip:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/bradleypotter/statuses/331854378078203904">@Bradleypotter</a></p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/another-company-goes-100-gpl" rel="bookmark" title="Another Company Goes 100% GPL">Another Company Goes 100% GPL</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/premiumthemes-net-goes-gpl" rel="bookmark" title="PremiumThemes.net Goes GPL">PremiumThemes.net Goes GPL</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/how-do-i-contribute-to-commercial-gpl-themes" rel="bookmark" title="How Do I Contribute To Commercial GPL Themes?">How Do I Contribute To Commercial GPL Themes?</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/iD6061j0jLA" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 May 2013 14:52:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WordPress.tv: John P.

It will be held on <strong>October 17th-19th</strong>. For those that don&#8217;t know, Pressnomics is a conference centered around the services and products that have created a successful and diverse economy around WordPress. Tickets go on sale <strong>June 19th at 10am PST</strong> and will be released in batches. From what I understand, there are a few folks that will be selectively invited to attend the conference, just like last year. </p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to attend the event last year but from all of the posts and tweets I read, it was one hell of an event I missed. I will do what I can to be in attendance this year. The primary reason I want to attend this conference is because most of the WordPress business movers and shakers are under one roof and there are a ton of things to learn from them. I want to seize that knowledge from these folks and pass it along to you. </p>\n<p>Here are a few links from attendees of last years event to give you a better idea of what this conference is all about.</p>\n<p>Alex King &#8211; <a href="http://itsmetherobot.appspot.com/alexking.org/blog/2012/11/13/pressnomics-2012">Pressnomics 2012</a><br />\nAZ Tech Beat &#8211; <a href="http://aztechbeat.com/2012/11/pressnomics-2012-day-1-2/">Key Takeaways From Pressnomics 2012 Day 1 &#8211; AZ Tech Beat</a><br />\nWebSavvy Marketing &#8211; <a href="http://www.web-savvy-marketing.com/2012/11/pressnomics-people-wordpress-core/">PressNomics: People Are The True WordPress Core</a><br />\nWebDevStudios &#8211; <a href="http://webdevstudios.com/2012/11/13/pressnomics-not-just-another-wordcamp/">Pressnomics &#8211; Not Just Another WordCamp</a></p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/pressnomics-conference-specifically-for-commercial-entities" rel="bookmark" title="PressNomics &#8211; Conference Specifically For Commercial WordPress Entities">PressNomics &#8211; Conference Specifically For Commercial WordPress Entities</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/-9bfGAH0eWA" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 May 2013 17:22:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"WPTavern: Searching For A Better WordPress Search";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6819";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:101:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/19hutSdYz4I/searching-for-a-better-wordpress-search";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5260:"<p>On May 6th, the WordPress VIP team blog <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/vip-search/">announced</a> a new VIP service they&#8217;ll be offering centered around search. While at first it may be surprising that the default search in WordPress was not used in their latest project, the fact is, WordPress search in its current state can not perform complex search queries without using a considerable amount of computational resources which spells doom for users on shared webhosting. The VIP Search Add-on uses third party software called <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a> which is open source and can be used by anyone. However, upon looking at the requirements and the methods of setting it up, it&#8217;s only meant for those that have the ability to run software on their hosting accounts either through a dedicated box or VPS. By using Elastic search, the VIP team was able to provide search capabilities such as being able to filter between the different types of content, categories, tags, authors, date ranges and more. To see the advanced search capabilities in action, check out <a href="http://kff.org/search/">http://kff.org/search/</a>. I reached out to Paul Maiorana, Vice President of Platform Services for Automattic but was unable to get a response I could share with the public. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/VIPsearch.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/VIPsearch.jpg?resize=300%2C136" alt="VIP Search box" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6820" /></a></p>\n<p>I briefly conversed with other members of the WordPress community on Twitter on why WordPress does not already have those advanced search queries out of the box. The gist of the conversation was that performing such intensive searches would be too much for the limited resources shared hosting provides. It was also mentioned that most of the functionality can be achieved using Google Custom Search. In fact, Matt Mullenwegs personal WordPress site Ma.tt runs Google Custom Search. </p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, back in 2009, Matt <a href="http://ma.tt/2009/07/acquia-searc/">published a post</a> that highlighted a new hosted service called Acquia Search that Drupal users could tap into. At the time, commenters urged Matt to continue to improve the search capabilities in WordPress as some users were not fans of relying on a third party service. Matt&#8217;s response was:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yes and there is a Google Summer of Code project on this right now, but as with video processing we’re limited by the resources available to us by default and it’s something that could be fairly efficiently done as a remote service.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you can <a href="http://wpsoc09.wordpress.com/2009/03/29/extended-wordpress-search-engine/">see the proposal</a> for that Google Summer Of Code project here. <a href="http://andy.wordpress.com/2009/08/21/wordpress-search-plugin/">According to Justin&#8217;s mentor Andy Skelton</a>, Justin Shreve was successful in completing his search API project which the results can be found within the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search/">plugin repository</a> except that the plugin has not been updated for over two years. After asking around to see if the search API ever made it to core, it appears not. </p>\n<p>So while I don&#8217;t see any major improvement taking place in the near future for the core implementation of search, there are a few plugins out there that improve the situation. In fact, if you conduct a search of the WordPress plugin repository using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=search">keyword of search</a>, 16 results show up although not all of the results are specifically tailored for the search functionality of WordPress. I personally have not yet taken the time to evaluate the different plugins but I have heard from a number of users that <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/relevanssi/">Relevanssi</a> is a good solution. Of course, there is always <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-custom-search/">Google Custom Search</a> which has a proven track record.</p>\n<p>Do you think having better search functionality in WordPress is worth paying for? Have you installed any plugins or have manually improved the search capabilities on your website? Let me know your thoughts in the comments on the state of search in WordPress. </p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/improving-the-wordpress-search-engine-with-relevanssi" rel="bookmark" title="Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi">Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/adding-google-custom-search-is-easy" rel="bookmark" title="Adding Google Custom Search Is Easy">Adding Google Custom Search Is Easy</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/searching-only-the-codex" rel="bookmark" title="Searching Only The Codex">Searching Only The Codex</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/19hutSdYz4I" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 May 2013 15:46:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"Joseph: Scaling WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://josephscott.org/?p=7653";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"http://josephscott.org/archives/2013/05/scaling-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:177:"<p>I&#8217;ve posted the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/josephscott/scaling-wordpress-20731197">slides from my &#8216;Scaling WordPress&#8217; presentation</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 May 2013 14:43:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Joseph Scott";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"WPTavern: WordPress Deployment Survey Results";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6816";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/Zh7fcn6A1Og/wordpress-deployment-survey-results";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1473:"<p>Interesting bit of <a href="http://wp.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/15/wordpress-deployment-survey/">survey results</a> published by Kieran Masterton on Smashing WordPress today.

The initial idea was to change core around so that developers could pre-configure WordPress with a set of activated plugins while also being able to change/activate the default theme. The idea was championed at the time but the implementation was up for debate. Fast forward to today and there is now a free service called <a href="http://wproller.com/">WPRoller</a> which looks like a great solution to the problem, without having to do anything to the core of WordPress. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wproller-wpversion.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wproller-wpversion.jpg?resize=300%2C138" alt="WPRoller Choosing Which Version Of WordPress To Install" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6808" /></a></p>\n<p>Without needing to register an account, you simply scroll down the page and select which version of WordPress you&#8217;d like to use, either the latest stable version or the nightly build. Then, scroll through the various categories of plugins and select the ones you&#8217;d like to install along with WordPress. While at first I was disappointed that I couldn&#8217;t search the repository and just add whatever plugin I wanted, it then dawned on me how much more sense it makes to just list some of the most popular plugins in their respective categories. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wproller-choosingplugins.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wproller-choosingplugins.jpg?resize=300%2C171" alt="Choosing WordPress Plugins" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6809" /></a></p>\n<p>During the initial launch of the service, users were unable to add plugins that were not already on the list. However, the site has recently undergone some updates so that you can now create a profile. Users can now upload themes and plugins to their WPRoller profile that will also be rolled into their custom WordPress installation. A killer feature if you ask me. Any theme or plugin that is uploaded to your profile is private. No one else can access that information which should generate a sigh of relief from commercial theme and plugin companies. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wproller-profile.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wproller-profile.jpg?resize=300%2C138" alt="WPRoller Profiles" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6810" /></a></p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve gone through and created your WordPress package, you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to save it for future re-use. Being able to have multiple WordPress packages saved to your profile provides the ability to easily have different installations based on a clients/users needs. All of this is accomplished without modifying the core of WordPress which again, is a nice feature in and of itself. Depending upon how many plugins are added to a WordPress package, the zip file will range between 5-100 megs in size. So if you end up timing the 5 minute WordPress install claim, don&#8217;t add the time it takes to upload the zip file as that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t believe this website is free. As far as I can tell, there doesn&#8217;t appear to be a limit to the amount of plugins in the package, size of the zip file, or the number of packages you can save to your profile. Oh, if you&#8217;re wondering whether or not the plugins packaged with your WordPress install are up to date, <a href="http://wproller.com/blog/wproller-com-updates/plugins-updated-3-27-2013/">WPRoller says</a> they have a nightly Cron job running to make sure the latest versions end up in your installation zip file. While their last blog post was on April 10th, WPRoller has plans to allow custom install.php, wp-config.php and .htaccess files as well as installation starter packages for particular use case segments.</p>\n<p>So what I want to know from you is whether or not you&#8217;ve used this service and if so, has it really made your life of launching WordPress based sites easier? After all, this was only a pipe dream 4 years ago, and while plugins have been released since then to sort of create various WordPress install profiles, I just love the simplicity of how WPRoller executes its mission.</p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/six-revisions-on-missing-features-in-wordpress" rel="bookmark" title="Six Revisions On Missing Features In WordPress">Six Revisions On Missing Features In WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/custom-install-profiles-sounds-like-a-cool-idea" rel="bookmark" title="Custom Install Profiles Sounds Like A Cool Idea">Custom Install Profiles Sounds Like A Cool Idea</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/favoriting-posts-in-wordpress" rel="bookmark" title="Favoriting Posts In WordPress">Favoriting Posts In WordPress</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/fAU7A6fErwI" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 May 2013 20:41:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WordPress.tv: Steve Burge: How to Make Great Tutorial WordPress Videos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=18855";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/06/steve-burge-how-to-make-great-tutorial-wordpress-videos/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:690:"<div id="v-DiPjDDdN-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/18855/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/18855/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=18855&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/06/steve-burge-how-to-make-great-tutorial-wordpress-videos/"><img alt="Steve Burge: How to Make Great Tutorial WordPress Videos" src="http://videos.videopress.com/DiPjDDdN/video-8c06be2fea_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 May 2013 16:13:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"WPTavern: First WordCamp North Canton A Success";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6768";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/v2lT_-FS3bQ/first-wordcamp-north-canton-a-success";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5372:"<p>Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to attend <a href="http://2013.northcanton.wordcamp.org/" title="WordCamp NorthCanton">WordCamp North Canton</a> located in North Canton, Ohio.

The venue offered plenty of seating, multiple classrooms for sessions and outlets galore for charging electronic devices.

Everything used during the event was either recyclable or fully bio-degradable. There was a station set up in the back of the main room staffed by volunteers to help make sure things were put in the proper place. Having zero waste at a WordCamp event is beneficial no matter how you look at it. From what I heard, Joe Rozsa will be putting together a tutorial for how he accomplished this feat which will be shared on WordCamp.org for other organizers to take advantage of. </p>\n<p>One of the highlights for me was the lunch prepared by <a href="http://ermannospizza.com/">Ermannos pizza</a>. They brought in a selection of pizzas but my favorite was their Margherita which contained Extra Virgin Olive oil Infused with Garlic, their Triple Blend Cheese, Roma Tomatoes, Fresh Basil. Topped with Parmesan &#038; Romano Cheese, Italian Herbs &#038; Seasonings, and Balsamic Glaze. This pizza was awesome and when I&#8217;m back in the North Canton area, I&#8217;ll definitely be stopping by for some more. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/119.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/119.jpg?resize=224%2C300" alt="119" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6776" /></a></p>\n<p>One other treat that I&#8217;ve not seen at any WordCamps is S&#8217;mores. Ermanno&#8217;s also baked ravioli stuffed s&#8217;mores that were fluffy, gooey pastries filled with marshmallow and chocolate. While I managed to eat two of them and then take a few home, I know of a few other attendees that couldn&#8217;t stop eating them. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/120.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/120.jpg?resize=223%2C300" alt="120" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6799" /></a></p>\n<p>Overall, the event was a major success for it being the first of it&#8217;s kind for the North Canton area. The sessions I attended were presented by people passionate about the subject they were talking about. Most of the people in the audience were either new to WordPress or had little to no development experience. I also wanted to point out that a lot of the attendees at this event were women. If s&#8217;mores didn&#8217;t cap off the camp in WordCamp, tents and sleeping bags were among some of the prizes given away at the end of the day. Joe Rozsa and his team of volunteer staff members are to be commended for a job well done.</p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a

class="attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="10 Years of WordPress" /></div><p>The official 10th anniversary of the release of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is May 27, 2013. It has been an amazing 10 years, during which WordPress evolved from a simple blogware to a very full-featured CMS (Content Management System), used to power some of the biggest and most popular web sites on the internet. All over the world, people are <a title="Party on, Wayne!" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/save-the-date-may-27/">planning celebrations</a>. As much as I like a good party, I thought this would also be a good time to celebrate WordPress by actually using WordPress &#8212; for blogging.</p>\n<p>So much of our content sharing these days tends to be via centralized &#8220;social&#8221; platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Tumblr, etc., that some of us neglect our blogs. I know <em>I&#8217;m</em> guilty of that. But this anniversary is a good excuse for the WordPress community to take a few minutes to consider their time with our favorite website building tool. Here&#8217;s what I propose&#8230;</p>\n<p><span id="more-64213"></span><br />\nThink about the past 10 years, and your time with WordPress. Maybe, like myself, you&#8217;ve been using WordPress since the beginning, or perhaps you just tried it out for the first time last month. But consider the events that stand out in your memory during that time. Now, write a blog post about it. Wherever you fall on the timeline, you should probably be able to write something about one or more of the following openings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;When WordPress was first released in 2003..&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;When I first started using WordPress&#8230;&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Since I first started using WordPress&#8230;&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, for example, I&#8217;ve been using WordPress pretty much since the beginning. I didn&#8217;t actually switch my blog until September 2003, but I&#8217;d been committing to core before that, so I might list things like,</p>\n<p>When WordPress was released in May 2003:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I was 36 years old</li>\n<li>I had been married for less than 2 years</li>\n<li>I already had nearly 10 years of web development experience</li>\n<li>My Pentium 4 laptop with 1GB of RAM was a screaming machine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I first started using WordPress in September 2003&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ellen Degeneres show had just debuted on TV</li>\n<li>The US Treasury redesigned the $20 bill</li>\n<li>George W.

It creates static pages that are served quickly by the web server. Sometimes however, users still want parts of their pages to remain dynamic and be non static. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/faq/">mfunc, mclude and dynamic-cached-content</a> came in.</p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately it was reported recently that remote visitors to sites using the plugin could execute any code they like by simply leaving a comment containing the right mfunc code. These functions are now disabled by default, and a filter removes harmful code from comments but if enabled they pose a security risk. I considered adding a security code to the mfunc tag but unfortunately the best way of dealing with this problem is to replace it completely with something different. The next release of the plugin will do away with mfunc, mclude and dynamic-cached-content entirely. </p>\n<p><strong>The new dynamic cache system</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/the-development-version-of-wp-super-cache/">development version of WP Super Cache</a> has already been updated with a new filter based system. It uses a cacheaction filter called &#8220;wpsc_cachedata&#8221;. This filter runs when a page is first cached and also when a cached page is subsequently served. It also runs when caching is disabled for known users, something that has always been broken when using mfunc.</p>\n<p>Almost all the data that is displayed on your website will run through the cacheaction filter &#8220;wpsc_cachedata&#8221;. When a page is first cached, the data that is shown to the first visitor of that page goes through that filter. The second visitor gets a cached page and that page too goes through the filter. What this allows us to do is define a template tag (or more than one) that a function hooked on that filter can search for in the filtered data. It can replace that tag with some other text, usually derived from code that has to run on each request. The visitor is then shown the page with the replaced tag.</p>\n<p><strong>Example code</strong></p>\n<p>The readme.txt hasn&#8217;t been updated yet but an example plugin, <a href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-super-cache/trunk/plugins/dynamic-cache-test.php">dynamic-cache-test.php</a> is included in WP Super Cache. It&#8217;s fairly simple but it&#8217;s documented so it should be easy enough to follow. A template tag is inserted at the bottom of the page using the wp_footer action, and a filter then replaces that tag with text and the current server time. That test plugin replaces mfunc code that would look like this, excluding the necessary code to hook on to wp_footer and print it.</p>\n<p><code>&lt;!--mfunc echo "&lt;!-- Hello world at " . date( ''H:i:s'' ) . " -->"; --><br />\n&lt;?php echo "&lt;!-- Hello world at " . date( ''H:i:s'' ) . " -->" ?><br />\n&lt;!--/mfunc--></code></p>\n<p>WP Super Cache has it&#8217;s own action hooks using add_cacheaction() and do_cacheaction(), and work like WordPress actions or filters. The reason the plugin needs those is because they are available <em>before</em> WordPress is loaded. They allow developers to hook into the plugin from the very start of the PHP process and modify how it works using plugins. Those plugins are usually copied into wp-super-cache/plugins/ but I encourage you to move that directory elsewhere because when WordPress updates the plugin it will delete any custom changes you make. The next time a new version of WP Super Cache comes out WordPress will delete the wp-super-cache folder, replacing it with the new update. In your wp-config.php set <code>$wp_cache_plugins_dir</code> to the location of the new plugins directory.</p>\n<p>If you use this filter system in your own plugin for distribution do not <em>ever</em> define the template tag for the user. Let the user decide what it is or generate a random tag and save it somewhere. It&#8217;s important to keep the tag secret so visitors cannot trigger your function maliciously. It is however better than the remote user running any code they like as was the case with mfunc!</p>\n<p>I hope to release a new version with this code late next week. If your plugin or site uses mfunc please download the <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/the-development-version-of-wp-super-cache/">development version</a> on a test server and start the process of updating your code.<br />\nOn the other hand, if you don&#8217;t want to update your mfunc tags you could try <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> instead. It uses the mfunc tag with a secret code.</p>\n<div align="center"><!--\n				google_ad_client = "pub-1076796686536503";\n			/* 336x280, created 22/05/09 */\n			google_ad_slot = "6456264552";\n			google_ad_width = 336;\n			google_ad_height = 280;\n			//-->\n				</div>\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2013/04/24/wp-super-cache-1-3-2/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 1.3.2">WP Super Cache 1.3.2</a></li><li> <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li></ul></p><p><a href="http://ocaoimh.ie/2013/05/01/mfunc-in-wp-super-cache-1-4-and-beyond/">mfunc in WP Super Cache 1.4 and beyond</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://ocaoimh.ie">Holy Shmoly!</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 01 May 2013 15:23:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Donncha";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.7.1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=163045";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://buddypress.org/2013/04/buddypress-1-7-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:899:"<p>BuddyPress 1.7.1 is now available.

caching is useful for caching HTML snippets that are expensive to generate and exist in multiple places on your site. It&#8217;s like full page HTML caching, but more granular, and it speeds up dynamic views.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://gist.github.com/markjaquith/2653957">this fragment caching class</a> for a few years now. I optimized it around ease of implementation. I wanted, as much as possible, to be able to identify a slow HTML-outputting block of code, and just wrap this code around it without having to refactor anything about the code inside.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Implementation is pretty easy, and you can reference the comment at the start of the code for that. The only thing to consider is that any variables that alter the output need to be build into the key. It should also be noted that this code assumes you have a persistent object cache backend.</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/4061/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/4061/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=4061&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Apr 2013 13:11:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Wed, 15 May 2013 09:32:46 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"135324";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Wed, 15 May 2013 09:15:29 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130307140136";}', 'no');

The show takes place at the hectic funeral, and later at the even more farcically chaotic wake, and depicts the siblings’ struggle to deal with their own personal dramas on top coming to terms with their father’s death. Years of suppressed tensions between the six characters come to the surface under the influence of large quantities of wine and a batch of hash cookies.', 'Shows', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '21-autosave', '', '', '2013-03-16 02:34:20', '2013-03-16 02:34:20', '', 21, 'http://perform.susu.org/gonerogue/?p=25', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

That chance might just have arrived in the form of billionaire-turned-theatre producer Mr Lupowski (Robin Johnson), whom Lloyd plans to charm into commissioning the work of old friend Brian McLeish and land himself the lead role. However his frivolous lifestyle manages to provide all manner of obstacles to his dream of returning to stardom.\r\n\r\nHeavily hungover after a particularly raucous party, he finds his drunken promises are coming back to haunt him. First to come calling at his Hyde Park apartment is star-struck budding writer Nigel, a timid young man in perpetual awe of his idol Lloyd.

Since then he has gone on to appear in plays and musicals such as <em>Oklahoma! </em>as Curly<em>, </em><em>Grease </em>as Kenickie<em>, </em><em>When We Are Married </em>as Herbert Soppit and <em>The Memory of Water </em>as Mike. With the University Theatre Group has performed as Pip in <em>Great Expectations </em>(5 Stars) and Sebastian in <em>Twelfth Night </em>(5 Stars) and is currently cast as Joe in <em>Keeping Down with the Joneses.</em>\r\n<h4>Sarah Divall - Celia Monroe</h4>\r\nActing started for Sarah when she was nine, after her parents decided that paying for drama lessons was preferable to another one woman play in the in the living room. Since then she has never looked back and has been involved in many productions, her favourites including <em>Macbeth </em>(Lady Macbeth), <em>Twelfth Night</em> (Olivia) and <em>The Goblin Men</em> (a touring TiE production in which she played a bright pink fairy). While at University she has continued acting, first as Adriana in <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> and more recently Mrs Sheinkopf in <em>FAME</em>. She is also working alongside Jed Marshall in <em>Friends and Wellwishers</em> an independent film and with the University television station on their medieval revenge drama <em>Elfrida</em>.\r\n<h4>Amy Fitzgibbon - Angela Bruce-Howard</h4>\r\nAmy has loved acting from around the age of 12. She had parts in several secondary school productions including Jan in <em>Grease</em> and Blousey in <em>Bugsy Malone</em>. Last year she continued acting at University and has since been in 5 shows with the Theatre Group society including Edward Bond''s <em>Lear </em>at the Nuffield Theatre in Southampton and has had supporting female roles in 2 original plays, Vindice and Ruthlessness, the latter of which she was lucky enough to perform for 3 weeks in the Edinburgh Fringe festival 2012 with University''s Theatre Group. She has produced a production of Shakespeare''s <em>The Comedy of Errors </em>and starred as Lady Macduff in <em>Macbeth.</em> She is currently starring as Miss Sherman in a production of<em> FAME</em> with the Musical Theatre Society also at University.\r\n<h4>Patrick Haste - Patryk Ozga</h4>\r\nSince playing Zeus at the age of 11, Patrick has been a passionately committed actor, winning his school''s drama festival with an original play at the age of 14 and recitation competition at 13. Throughout his career he has taken on a variety of roles, sometimes within the same play, with great succes. His recent plays include <em>Much Ado about Nothing </em>(<em>as Don Pedro</em>), the <em>Comedy of Errors  (as the intimidating law-enforcer of Ephesus who wishes Aegeon dead - 4 stars) </em>and <em>Catch-22  (as Major Major, a grieving irish father and brutal military policeman - 4 stars</em>). Always willing to contribute new ideas to any production he is in, Patrick is renowned for the intensity that he brings to every role he is in, however similar or different the character is to himself, camp or macho, and he wishes to pursue a career as an actor at all cost.\r\n<h4>Robin Johnson - Igor Lupowski</h4>\r\nRobin has only existed on the theatrical plane for four years but with fourteen productions already under his belt, it''s safe to assume he has caught the thespian bug. Amongst these credits include roles in the iconic musicals <em>Les Miserables</em>, <em>Sweeney Todd</em> and <em>Parade</em> (4 stars), alongside a starring turn as <em>The Producers'' </em>Leo Bloom in the opening of a local theatre. When not pretending to keep in time with choreography, his acting roles include Joe Gargery in the University Theatre Group''s <em>Great Expectations</em> (5 stars) and Mr Kirby in <em>You Can''t Take It With You</em>. He has also made a recent stand-up comedy debut, and is currently co-directing a production of <em>Keeping Down With the Joneses</em>. When not under a spotlight, Robin masquerades as a Software Engineering student, although having thrived off the adrenaline of performances for so long now, he expects to end up in the performing world one way or another.\r\n<h4>Jed Marshall - Lloyd Bruce-Howard</h4>\r\nJed is currently the lead role in an independent film production <em>Friends and well-wishers</em>; a dark comedy drama, co-directing a production of <em>Keeping down with the Joneses </em>and is in the planning stages of directing <em>Marat/Sade </em>in the University’s theatre. Recently he played the lead role <em>Anthipholus of Syracuse</em> in Shakespeare’s <em>Comedy of Errors </em>(4 Stars) and has directed, written and starred in a sell-out comedy sketch show <em>Clusterf**k </em>(4 Stars). In his teens he has performed in the musical <em>Smokey Joe’s Café </em>and as <em>Irwin </em>in a reduced production of <em>The History Boys</em>. His no-holds-barred and energetic performance style makes him an instantly memorable and recognisable actor, he takes an intensive professional attitude to all attitudes of life and has ambitions to pursue a career in comedy writing and performance.\r\n<h4>Caitlin Meredith - Julia Bevan</h4>\r\nAlthough Caitlin''s first exposure to theatre was being cast as a ''Tree 2'' in the local church pantomime, she likes to think she has since refined her acting craft. During her time at secondary school she stared as Mrs Peterson in the musical<em> Bye Bye Birdie</em>, Mrs Erlynne in Wilde’s <em>Lady Windermere’s Fan</em> and Bottom in a performance of<em> A Midsummer Night’s Dream </em>at the Newbury Corn Exchange Theatre. Aside from donkeys and middle aged mothers, Caitlin played the roles of Linda in Berkoff’s <em>Dahling, You Were Marvelous</em> and Mrs. Pearce in <em>Confusions</em>, by Alan Ayckbourn during her time at King’s College London. As well as performing in Southampton University Theatre Group’s production of <em>A Comedy of Errors</em>, Caitlin has achieved Distinction in grade 8 of LAMDA Speech and Drama examinations.\r\n<h4>Luke Nicholls - Nigel Chapman</h4>\r\nLuke began his acting career aged 9 playing the role of Jesus for his school''s Easter play, followed soon afterwards by The Artful Dodger in <em>Oliver!</em> He has performed in a wide variety of roles in the ensuing years ranging from Malcolm in Macbeth to Lieutenant Schrank in <em>West Side Story</em>, and Bosun in <em>Return to the Forbidden Planet</em>. More recent performances include Colonel Cathcart in <em>Catch-22</em> with Southampton University, and Roger in <em>Rent </em>for Look Theatre in Wantage. Although Luke has had many serious acting roles he is very much looking forward to continuing his recent trend of appearing in comedies.\r\n<h4>Peter Ward - Brian McLeish</h4>\r\nPeter, or "Peewee" as he is generally known, is returning to the fringe for the third time this year, having previously Assistant Directed <em>Lillia </em>for SUSU Showstoppers, and last year starred in <em>Good Grief</em> for Gone Rogue Productions.  He started acting with the Gala Theatre Stage School in Durham at a young age and has been performing ever since, racking up a number of musicals and plays that he struggles to count nowadays.  Recent credits include "Thomas" in the UK premiere of <em>The Boys in the Photograph</em>, "Timms" in <em>The History Boys</em>, as well as directing the UK premiere of <em>[title of show]</em> and attending the National Student Drama festival as a member of the Festival Company.

That chance might just have arrived in the form of billionaire-turned-theatre producer Mr Lupowski (Robin Johnson), whom Lloyd plans to charm into commissioning the work of old friend Brian McLeish (Cam Bevan) and land himself the lead role. However his frivolous lifestyle manages to provide all manner of obstacles to his dream of returning to stardom.\r\n\r\nHeavily hungover after a particularly raucous party, he finds his drunken promises are coming back to haunt him. First to come calling at his Hyde Park apartment is star-struck budding writer Nigel, a timid young man in perpetual awe of his idol Lloyd. Soon to follow is Lloyd’s clingy mistress Celia (Sarah Divall), a very world-wearied Brian, Lloyd’s ballsy ex-wife Angela (Amy Fitzgibbon) and her brash American lover Roger (Chris Barlow), a leaking pipe and a disgruntled Polish plumber Patryk (Patrick Haste).\r\n<h3>Cast</h3>\r\n<h4>Chris Barlow</h4>\r\nRoger McClain\r\n<h4>Cam Bevan</h4>\r\nBrian McLeish\r\n<h4>Sarah Divall</h4>\r\nCelia Monroe\r\n<h4>Amy Fitzgibbon</h4>\r\nAngela Bruce-Howard\r\n<h4>Patrick Haste</h4>\r\nPatryk Ozga\r\n<h4>Robin Johnson</h4>\r\nIgor Lupowski\r\n<h4>Jed Marshall</h4>\r\nLloyd Bruce-Howard\r\n<h4>Caitlin Meredith</h4>\r\nJulia Bevan\r\n<h3>Production Team</h3>\r\n<h4>Mike Cottrell</h4>\r\nDirector\r\n<h4>Will Kynaston</h4>\r\nDirector\r\n<h4>Joe Buckingham</h4>\r\nProducer\r\n<h4>Caitlin Hobbs</h4>\r\nProducer\r\n<h4>Aoife Thomas</h4>\r\nProducer\r\n<h4>Alexandra Bray</h4>\r\nWriter\r\n<h4>Sophie Owers</h4>\r\nAssistant Producer\r\n<h4>Caitlin Meredith</h4>\r\nJulia Bevan', 'Hanging Bruce Howard', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '26-revision-2', '', '', '2013-03-07 16:53:24', '2013-03-07 16:53:24', '', 26, 'http://perform.susu.org/gonerogue/?p=45', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The audience witnesses the hectic funeral and the even more farcically chaotic wake, as the three siblings struggle to deal with their own personal dramas on top coming to terms with their father''s death.\r\n\r\nThis show is about a lot of things. It''s about a doomed relationship between a neurotic control freak and a self-absorbed rich kid. It''s about what happens when you accidentally invite a sex-deprived, middle aged French teacher to the wake of your father''s funeral. It''s about the effects of consuming large quantities of alcohol, and mixing it with Amsterdam''s finest green herb. It''s about the downfall of a feminist, vegan, environmentalist, activist lesbian who eats meat, fantasises over Robert Pattinson, and whose knowledge of political activism doesn''t stretch much further beyond quoting Ghandi and Princess Diana. It''s about what happens when your girlfriend''s sister catches you using her laptop to masturbate over "Sexy4U Selhurst Slut" at the wake of her father''s funeral.\r\n\r\nIt''s about the relationship between three siblings who lost their dad long before he died. It''s about their confusion over how to grieve someone who they barely even got to know. It''s about their fear of the future, and of the past. And it''s about their rediscovery of what it means to be a brother or a sister.\r\n\r\nIt''s about finding openings, rather than closure. It''s about asking questions, rather than getting answers. It''s about accepting being lost, rather than trying to be found.\r\n\r\nWe also threw in a dance with whips and leather.\r\n\r\n<a class="button button-red" href="?cat=8">more Good Grief...</a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cast</h3>\r\n<h4>Peter "Peewee" Ward</h4>\r\nFreddie Miller\r\n<h4>Sophie Owen</h4>\r\nCharlotte Miller\r\n<h4>Jenny Deacon</h4>\r\nTilly Miller\r\n<h4>Alex "Teddy" Clements</h4>\r\nPhil Reynolds\r\n<h4>Sarah Moir</h4>\r\nSam Hart\r\n<h4>Ashleigh Moore</h4>\r\nMiranda Robinson\r\n<h3>Production Team</h3>\r\n<h4>Chris Duncan</h4>\r\nDirector / Producer\r\n<h4>Megan Gibson</h4>\r\nDirector\r\n<h4>Stephanie Amies</h4>\r\nMusical Director\r\n<h4>Lizzie Bielicki</h4>\r\nAssistant Musical Director / Producer\r\n<h4>Sarah Elliot</h4>\r\nChoreographer\r\n<h4>Lucy Hughes</h4>\r\nProducer\r\n<h4>Jenni McDowall</h4>\r\nProducer\r\n<h4>Theresa Crisham</h4>\r\nAssistant Producer / Technical Director', 'Good Grief', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'closed', '', '66-revision-4', '', '', '2013-03-07 21:29:09', '2013-03-07 21:29:09', '', 66, 'http://perform.susu.org/gonerogue/?p=103', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

New Labour have just won a landslide victory at the polls. Following the death of mob boss ‘Daddy Carlyle’, his son takes control of his criminal empire and sets his sights on owning local politician Deborah King, by rigging the up and coming title bout for the middle-weight championship of the world. In the meantime two low-level gangsters, Lenny and Guy, default on their debt to the new boss, young Carlyle, and are driven to desperate measures to raise the cash. They successfully blackmail boxing contender Metal Mickey (who is gay) into throwing the fight. But, unbeknownst to them, Metal Mickey is owned by Carlyle and, in so doing, they derail his plot.

Since then he has gone on to appear in plays and musicals such as <em>Oklahoma! </em>as Curly<em>, </em><em>Grease </em>as Kenickie<em>, </em><em>When We Are Married </em>as Herbert Soppit and <em>The Memory of Water </em>as Mike. With the University Theatre Group has performed as Pip in <em>Great Expectations </em>(5 Stars) and Sebastian in <em>Twelfth Night </em>(5 Stars) and is currently cast as Joe in <em>Keeping Down with the Joneses.</em>\r\n<h4>Sarah Divall - Celia Monroe</h4>\r\n<h4>Amy Fitzgibbon - Angela Bruce-Howard</h4>\r\nAmy has loved acting from around the age of 12. She had parts in several secondary school productions including Jan in <em>Grease</em> and Blousey in <em>Bugsy Malone</em>. Last year she continued acting at University and has since been in 5 shows with the Theatre Group society including Edward Bond''s <em>Lear </em>at the Nuffield Theatre in Southampton and has had supporting female roles in 2 original plays, Vindice and Ruthlessness, the latter of which she was lucky enough to perform for 3 weeks in the Edinburgh Fringe festival 2012 with University''s Theatre Group. She has produced a production of Shakespeare''s <em>The Comedy of Errors </em>and starred as Lady Macduff in <em>Macbeth.</em> She is currently starring as Miss Sherman in a production of<em> FAME</em> with the Musical Theatre Society also at University.\r\n<h4>Patrick Haste - Patryk Ozga</h4>\r\nSince playing Zeus at the age of 11, Patrick has been a passionately committed actor, winning his school''s drama festival with an original play at the age of 14 and recitation competition at 13. Throughout his career he has taken on a variety of roles, sometimes within the same play, with great succes. His recent plays include <em>Much Ado about Nothing </em>(<em>as Don Pedro</em>), the <em>Comedy of Errors  (as the intimidating law-enforcer of Ephesus who wishes Aegeon dead - 4 stars) </em>and <em>Catch-22  (as Major Major, a grieving irish father and brutal military policeman - 4 stars</em>). Always willing to contribute new ideas to any production he is in, Patrick is renowned for the intensity that he brings to every role he is in, however similar or different the character is to himself, camp or macho, and he wishes to pursue a career as an actor at all cost.\r\n<h4>Robin Johnson - Igor Lupowski</h4>\r\nRobin has only existed on the theatrical plane for four years but with fourteen productions already under his belt, it''s safe to assume he has caught the thespian bug. Amongst these credits include roles in the iconic musicals <em>Les Miserables</em>, <em>Sweeney Todd</em> and <em>Parade</em> (4 stars), alongside a starring turn as <em>The Producers'' </em>Leo Bloom in the opening of a local theatre.

That chance might just have arrived in the form of billionaire-turned-theatre producer Mr Lupowski (Robin Johnson), whom Lloyd plans to charm into commissioning the work of old friend Brian McLeish and land himself the lead role. However his frivolous lifestyle manages to provide all manner of obstacles to his dream of returning to stardom.\r\n\r\nHeavily hungover after a particularly raucous party, he finds his drunken promises are coming back to haunt him. First to come calling at his Hyde Park apartment is star-struck budding writer Nigel, a timid young man in perpetual awe of his idol Lloyd. Soon to follow is Lloyd’s clingy mistress Celia (Sarah Divall), a very world-wearied Brian, Lloyd’s ballsy ex-wife Angela (Amy Fitzgibbon) and her brash American lover Roger (Chris Barlow), a leaking pipe and a disgruntled Polish plumber Patryk (Patrick Haste).\r\n\r\n<a class="button button-red" href="?cat=4">more Hanging Bruce-Howard...</a>\r\n<h3>Cast</h3>\r\n<h4>Chris Barlow - Roger McClain</h4>\r\nChris has been acting from the tender age of 10 and became obsessed with the stage when he was cast in his junior school''s easter production as singing cowboy Jesus. Since then he has gone on to appear in plays and musicals such as <em>Oklahoma! </em>as Curly<em>, </em><em>Grease </em>as Kenickie<em>, </em><em>When We Are Married </em>as Herbert Soppit and <em>The Memory of Water </em>as Mike. With the University Theatre Group has performed as Pip in <em>Great Expectations </em>(5 Stars) and Sebastian in <em>Twelfth Night </em>(5 Stars) and is currently cast as Joe in <em>Keeping Down with the Joneses.</em>\r\n<h4>Sarah Divall - Celia Monroe</h4>\r\n<h4>Amy Fitzgibbon - Angela Bruce-Howard</h4>\r\nAmy has loved acting from around the age of 12. She had parts in several secondary school productions including Jan in <em>Grease</em> and Blousey in <em>Bugsy Malone</em>. Last year she continued acting at University and has since been in 5 shows with the Theatre Group society including Edward Bond''s <em>Lear </em>at the Nuffield Theatre in Southampton and has had supporting female roles in 2 original plays, Vindice and Ruthlessness, the latter of which she was lucky enough to perform for 3 weeks in the Edinburgh Fringe festival 2012 with University''s Theatre Group. She has produced a production of Shakespeare''s <em>The Comedy of Errors </em>and starred as Lady Macduff in <em>Macbeth.</em> She is currently starring as Miss Sherman in a production of<em> FAME</em> with the Musical Theatre Society also at University.\r\n<h4>Patrick Haste - Patryk Ozga</h4>\r\nSince playing Zeus at the age of 11, Patrick has been a passionately committed actor, winning his school''s drama festival with an original play at the age of 14 and recitation competition at 13. Throughout his career he has taken on a variety of roles, sometimes within the same play, with great succes. His recent plays include <em>Much Ado about Nothing </em>(<em>as Don Pedro</em>), the <em>Comedy of Errors  (as the intimidating law-enforcer of Ephesus who wishes Aegeon dead - 4 stars) </em>and <em>Catch-22  (as Major Major, a grieving irish father and brutal military policeman - 4 stars</em>). Always willing to contribute new ideas to any production he is in, Patrick is renowned for the intensity that he brings to every role he is in, however similar or different the character is to himself, camp or macho, and he wishes to pursue a career as an actor at all cost.\r\n<h4>Robin Johnson - Igor Lupowski</h4>\r\nRobin has only existed on the theatrical plane for four years but with fourteen productions already under his belt, it''s safe to assume he has caught the thespian bug. Amongst these credits include roles in the iconic musicals <em>Les Miserables</em>, <em>Sweeney Todd</em> and <em>Parade</em> (4 stars), alongside a starring turn as <em>The Producers'' </em>Leo Bloom in the opening of a local theatre. When not pretending to keep in time with choreography, his acting roles include Joe Gargery in the University Theatre Group''s <em>Great Expectations</em> (5 stars) and Mr Kirby in <em>You Can''t Take It With You</em>. He has also made a recent stand-up comedy debut, and is currently co-directing a production of <em>Keeping Down With the Joneses</em>. When not under a spotlight, Robin masquerades as a Software Engineering student, although having thrived off the adrenaline of performances for so long now, he expects to end up in the performing world one way or another.\r\n<h4>Jed Marshall - Lloyd Bruce-Howard</h4>\r\nJed is currently the lead role in an independent film production <em>Friends and well-wishers</em>; a dark comedy drama, co-directing a production of <em>Keeping down with the Joneses </em>and is in the planning stages of directing <em>Marat/Sade </em>in the University’s theatre.

Just Kidding, but now I have your attention&#8230;</h3>\n<p>In the last few months i have been tasked to undergo a sites review, which, when completed will be some form of document that tells us more about our Sites students, in regards to who they are, what they do, what they already have from SUSU, and what they need. This will become a very important document to refer to for the completion of the Union Plan, and become the basis of how SUSU interacts with Sites students, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Earlier on in the month the outcomes and recommendations which came from the audit was presented at Union Council, which helped us form our overall vision. Here&#8217;s what they are:</p>\n<h5>1. Educate and inform students about SUSU.</h5>\n<p>Recommendation 1 applies to all sites. It is important that students have an informed idea of what SUSU is and what it offers students of the University of Southampton before we put anything in place for them.</p>\n<p>The opinion of SUSU from many sites students is not necessarily a good one. I believe this is due to students not understanding what a union really is. They need to understand that SUSU is not a place in Southampton for only Southampton students to enjoy, but a fantastic opportunity that should encompass all students. How can we get students engaging with SUSU if they do not know about it?</p>\n<h5>2. Facilitate a Travel Plan that meets their needs.</h5>\n<p>We are aware from the audit that the Winchester School of Art campus is roughly 11 miles away from the main campus, and students studying there are not happy with the current travel service.</p>\n<p>This may be due to students no knowing about the current services and subsidies available to them, or the current service may not meet the needs of the students.</p>\n<p>This year there has been an increase of Winchester students engaging with the societies, sports, events and facilities at Highfield, they need a way of getting there.</p>\n<h5>3. Utilize the Union-Winchester</h5>\n<p>The union in Winchester is a large space which is full of potential to use for their own activities and societies, but it does not get used.</p>\n<p>The facilities are rather run down compared to those at other campuses, not to mention students are not aware when the space is available to them.</p>\n<p>Currently SUSU does not offer much in the way of catering services, leaving students to go to the university run ‘Lattes’.</p>\n<h5>4. Get Winchester on our Website, or, wsa.susu.org?</h5>\n<p>Currently there is no information about Winchester on the SUSU website, which could leave students to believe WSA students are not members of SUSU.</p>\n<p>There needs to be something on the website that tells students at Winchester they are members, and that we care. This could be by having a Winchester page on the ‘something for everyone’ tab, where students can upload there work and show SUSU what students get up to, which can show an appreciation for art. It could also display information and activity that is relevant to them. For example: SUSU events or, ‘how to get to Highfield’.</p>\n<p>We could even take into consideration a possibility of WSA students having their own website, like MEDSOC (medsoc.susu.org… wsa.susu.org?).</p>\n<p>At the moment the website doesn’t really convey the message that WSA students are a part of SUSU, which is an important concern when you take into consideration that the website is really the first place people interact with SUSU before they become students under the University of Southampton. How would you know if you chose to go to WSA that you are a part of SUSU if there is nothing to say it is on the main website?</p>\n<h5>5. More support for the Medical Society (MEDSOC)</h5>\n<p>It is important to have and show a good relationship between SUSU and MEDSOC. After all, MEDSOC is a part of and funded by SUSU, we should be supporting them within all their own activities and services and build a presence within MEDSOC.</p>\n<p>MEDSOC has a large presence and have become highly independent at SGH and almost acts as a ‘sub’ student union for SUSU, as you can see from the audit. The society has quite a lot of respect from medics; it is important for SUSU to support the society and build a stronger relationship to ensure SUSU cares and is present at the site.</p>\n<h5>6. Regular and Sustainable access to SUSU officers</h5>\n<p>It is important that students at SGH gain regular and sustainable access to officers and staff, so their voices can be heard and any issue within the attention of SUSU, and can be improved no matter what the issue. We need to show we care.</p>\n<p>It gives sites students the same opportunity to speak to and engage with their officers and student leaders just as students at Highfield have.</p>\n<h5>7. Something for everyone</h5>\n<p>SGH is not just for Medicine students, but also for students who study nursing and midwifery. There should be strategy that focuses on catering for those students needs also. This could be by creating a sustainable day event that happens weekly brings both medicine and health sciences students together, or developing and supporting NAMSOC.</p>\n<p>There are approximately 800 students studying a course with the Faculty of Health Science, it is important these students gain the same equal support as students studying Medicine.</p>\n<h5>6. Regular and Sustainable access to SUSU officers</h5>\n<p>It is also important that students at NOC gain regular and sustainable access to officers and staff, so their voices can be heard and any issue within the attention of SUSU, and can be improved no matter what the issue. We need to show we care.</p>\n<p>It gives sites students the same opportunity to speak to and engage with their officers and student leaders just as students at Highfield have.</p>\n<h5>8. Communication strategy for NOC</h5>\n<p>An audit of all communication channels at NOC (it might be you have to invest to create some new ones, for example, maybe a specific NOC Society board that NOCSOC can use to promote their own events and activities), and from that create a system for when we do stuff here that is relevant for NOC students, when can use the audit of communication channels to know how we can get our services and current events/campaigns to them.</p>\n<p>By knowing what the communication channels are, it will be easier to keep students at NOC up to date on current activities, events or campaigns, and therefore begin to engage with SUSU.</p>\n<h5>9. Implement and Support a NOC Community</h5>\n<p>WSA and SGH are similar in a sense that they both have their own community within their own campuses, where they cater and support one another. I think NOC could benefit by having something similar, and could start by developing NOCSOC or developing the student centre.</p>\n<p>Community is important within a campus as students can run their own activities, support one another and understand they can voice the issues happening with in their campus. It is important for SUSU to help run and support this culture that will benefit these students.</p>\n<h5>10. Adopt Appropriate Recommendations to Placement Sites</h5>\n<p>Use relevant recommendations above to help support students on Placements.</p>\n<p>Most of the recommendations above already supply us with an outline of how we support these students. For example; by communicating the relevant information to them via a communication strategy, or supporting students by listening to their opinions by regular access to Officers.</p>\n<p>And with all this in mind, here is the overall vision:</p>\n<h3 style="text-align: center"> <strong>Vision – ‘</strong>Every student feels like they are a member of SUSU.’</h3>\n<p style="text-align: left">So there you have it folks!

We’re over two years into this journey and we’re making <a href="https://www.susu.org/about/annual-review" target="_blank">great progress </a> but this year we’ve decided to invest some addition funds into giving the progress on bits of the plan a little boost.</strong></p>\n<p>We’ve developed the SUSU Innovations Fund which aims to fund projects which have the potential to further an area of work outlined by the <a href="https://www.susu.org/about/union-plan" target="_blank">Union Plan</a><strong></strong>. The funding is not for capital (as SUSU already invests heavily in capital spending), and projects must have the potential to become financially stable after the initial burst of funding.</p>\n<p>Any Student, Union Staff Member, or Student Group may apply to the fund, and a proposal must be supported by a Sabbatical Officer or Senior Manager.</p>\n<p>For more details on the terms and conditions have a look at the<a href="https://www.susu.org/downloads/innovations-fund-procedure.pdf" target="_blank"> Funding Panel Procedure</a></p>\n<p>There will be a minimum of three panels in the year, and there is approximately £30,000-£50,000 available for this year (Up until July 31<sup>st</sup>)</p>\n<p>So, if you’ve got a bright idea and know of a great project that will make the Union even better just get in <a href="http://www.susu.org/contact.html" target="_blank">contact</a> and we’ll talk to you more about how to make that idea happen.</p>\n<p><a

Recognising brilliance is just as important as recognising areas for improvement, because that way, it&#8217;s clear what does work and resonates with students, which can then be easily implemented by other lecturers.</p>\n<p>The Teaching Awards look to address this imbalance, and in March, you will have the opportunity to nominate your favourite lecturer across a range of categories. Every student will be able to nominate their favourite lecturer, before a series of selection panels made up of your Course Representatives, Academic Presidents, and Faculty Officers help decide who the winners for each award are at an Academic Unit, Faculty, and University level, based on your nominations.</p>\n<p>March may be a long way off, but start thinking about who you would want to nominate. In its first year of running the Awards, we’ve decided to have 5 categories in total, covering all aspects of your teaching, learning, assessment and support experience, which you can see below.</p>\n<p><em>What do you think about the idea of Teaching Awards?

as being the lead representative in those areas, whilst the others are part-time voluntary positions;</li>\n<li><strong>Student Leaders</strong> are the leaders in their activity area, co-ordinating all activity within it;</li>\n<li><strong>Union Councillors</strong> are the members of SUSU who hold the Sabbatical Officers to account at Union Council (6 times a year), as well as voting on what policies SUSU should adopt and political stances it should take;</li>\n<li>and <strong>Trustees</strong> are the financial equivalent of Union Councillors, focusing on the running of

The presenter claims to have been healed and also can see now because of her faith and her brain.</p>\n<p>15:28 &#8211; check out the <a href="http://www.susu.org/downloads/m_&amp;_a_final.pdf" target="_blank">mem and art</a>s that explain about how SUSU works with faith groups:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8221;3.2 The Objects are to be carried out in complete independence of all religious and<br />\npolitical groups and in such a manner as not to discriminate unreasonably between<br />\nmembers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>15:29 &#8211; Apparently this is more than just a religion.</p>\n<p>15:30 &#8211; Q4. is it okay to advertise that your society can cure cancer? a. there are lots of testimonies on their website that say they can.</p>\n<p>15:37 &#8211; long deliberation from the committee.

Its better to diversify and concentrate on what they are good at, suggestion to have an undergrad rep on their committee.</p>\n<p>15:51 &#8211; Reasonable discussion with committee about BioSoc overlap, however there is a clear need for this society and there are people keen to run it.</p>\n<p>15:52 &#8211; Biological Sciences Postgraduate Society ( BSPS) &#8211; <strong>Affiliated</strong></p>\n<p>15:55 &#8211; CookCook Society &#8211; Two members who are presenting an idea about a society which teaches people how to cook quick healthy meals in a fun process.

It also means that different student groups and committees can work together better because they&#8217;ll be meeting together within their zones.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left">2) Rather than just having a one-size fits all approach to our committees, we&#8217;ve split them up into two &#8211; <strong>policy zones</strong> and <strong>activity zones</strong>. 3 zones are on the left-hand-side because they are mainly there to set policy and values that ALL the committees of the Union can live by e.g. Ethical and Environmental committee making sure that the whole Union is being ethical in its activity / International committee making sure that all the activity zones are inclusive for International students. 5 zones are on the right-hand-side because they do a certain activity, and so can make real and direct change for students. However, it isn&#8217;t a complete split &#8211; policy zones can still run events (activities) and activity zones can still set policy (it&#8217;s just more likely to be policy about their specific zone).</p>\n<p style="text-align: left">3) We should put the &#8216;small bubbles&#8217; together based on <em>what they do</em>; rather than just where they fit now. This means that we have a few different groupings than we do at the moment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Student Communities zone is formed based around cohorts of students that are pre-determined i.e. once you get here, you&#8217;re either in them or you&#8217;re not &#8211; you can&#8217;t choose to be an international student. This would include Sites, and also, interestingly, JCRs &#8211; here&#8217;s the thinking: JCRs are here to represent a group of students, they are not here to do a certain activity. Hence why they fit within this policy zone, rather than an activity zone (e.g. student engagement).</li>\n<li>Societies are supported based around what they do, rather than being lumped together in one place. International and cultural societies would be represented and supported within the Student Communities zone&#8230; Sports societies would be supported within the Sports Development zone. However, there would still be a central place that supports societies in terms of their affiliations, constitutions and elections, and this would sit within the democracy zone (because all that stuff already happens there on a SUSU-wide scale). This means that there is still a central place for our student groups, which can now run better, but also that societies get to be part of the relevant conversations around SUSU, rather than just having to hear what other societies are doing.</li>\n<li>Union Films, Performing Arts, Media Departments and music, arts and media societies would come together to form a &#8216;Creative Industries&#8217; Zone. These groups, do 2 things that are the same&#8230; Not only are they fun activities to get involved with, which are enriching for students&#8230; but they also produce content for the entire student body. SUSUtv don&#8217;t just get students involved in making television, they also create shows that any student can watch; like Performing Arts who put on their shows; like Union Films, who don&#8217;t just give students a chance to run a cinema, but also give students a chance to come and watch films right here in SUSU.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any thoughts about the review so far, then you can

Students have marched in national demonstrations, and the Union has put pressure on local MP’s to represent the wishes of a significant proportion of their constituents.</p>\n<p><a href="http://blogs.susu.org/policy/category/external/he-funding-and-student-financial-support/">http://blogs.susu.org/policy/category/external/he-funding-and-student-financial-support/</a></p>\n<p>A wide range of policy has been passed in this time, and currently the Union stands against the increasing of the cap, and the significant burden placed on individual students with no regards for the wider social and public benefit of a strong higher education system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">The University Stance:</span></strong></p>\n<p>In response to the changes in funding, and the raising of the cap the University took the decision in 2011 to increase its fees from 3k to 9k.</p>\n<p>This was in line with most of the sector. There was a great deal of debate surrounding this, and this year the Senate of the University (the highest academic decision making body) came out with this stance on the recent changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“The Senate of the University of Southampton reluctantly notes the introduction of higher fees for undergraduate degrees from September 2012.</li>\n<li>The Senate believes that these higher fees and associated student loans do not reflect a fair and reasonable balance between public and personal investment in higher education which the Senate believes will be detrimental not only to the University’s students but to higher education and society.</li>\n<li>The Senate expresses solidarity with the University’s students in peaceful and legal campaigning against the changes to student fees.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Southampton Students for Education pushed the Vice Chancellor on his personal position</strong> with regards to these changes, and the following was the response<sup>5</sup>:</p>\n<p>“As Chair of Senate, he actively participated in the preparation of three motions on behalf of the University community that were adopted following debate by Senate at its meeting in June 2012. This meeting of Senate was attended by the student representatives on Senate who participated fully in the debate and all are recorded as voting in favour of their adoption. The Vice-Chancellor voted for the three motions, which are reproduced below.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Southampton Students for Education’s Stance:</span></strong></p>\n<p>Southampton Students for Education are a student group lobbying group looking to raise awareness of amongst students of the damaging and ideological nature of the Governments HE Policy.</p>\n<p>Their stance is:</p>\n<p>“Education is not a luxury or a lifestyle choice, but a basic and vital means of personal and social development. As such it should be equally accessible for everyone, regardless of their circumstances. Higher education also has a vital economic role, but its value cannot simply be reduced to financial costs and benefits.</p>\n<p>We oppose tuition fees in higher education institutions. We also oppose any fees or hidden costs which might deter or limit equal access to higher education (e.g. compulsory course trips).</p>\n<p>We oppose the privatisation of higher education in the UK. Universities must remain publicly funded and higher education must not be commercialised or run along market ideals.</p>\n<p>We want to defend the quality and accessibility of teaching at Southampton University. The University governing body must be more vocal in opposing the HE White Paper, and it must take greater steps to protect Southampton students from its damaging effects<sup>6</sup>.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>What do you think, What can you do?</strong></span></p>\n<p>The above gives you an idea of where the key groups locally are in their stance on these changes.

height="454" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-816" /></a></p>\n<p>Today, we&#8217;ve jubilantly released version 2.3 of <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">WordPress for Android</a> to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android&hl=en">Google Play</a>. After updating, you&#8217;ll see right away that this release includes very exciting updates to the user interface. Let&#8217;s dive in to what&#8217;s new!</p>\n<h3>Action Bar</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/wordpress-for-android-version-2-3-action-bar-on-nexus-7.jpg"><img src="http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/wordpress-for-android-version-2-3-action-bar-on-nexus-7.jpg?w=620&h=295" alt="Version 2.3 of WordPress for Android: action bar on a Nexus 7" width="620" height="295" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-819" /></a><br />\nYou&#8217;ll notice a fresh, new look. We&#8217;ve taken into account Android&#8217;s &#8220;Holo&#8221; style guidelines and implemented the Action Bar interface throughout the app. If you&#8217;ve used any other apps designed for Android 4.0 or higher, you&#8217;ll feel right at home with the new user interface. Your Action Bar provides easy access to common actions such as creating a new post, refreshing, and sharing to other apps.</p>\n<p>We also couldn&#8217;t resist making the Action Bar in WordPress blue. <img src="http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>\n<h3>Menu Drawer</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/wordpress-for-android-version-2-3-menu-drawer-on-samsung-galaxy-s3-update.jpg"><img src="http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/wordpress-for-android-version-2-3-menu-drawer-on-samsung-galaxy-s3-update.jpg?w=242&h=491" alt="Version 2.3 of WordPress for Android: menu drawer on Samsung Galaxy S3" width="242" height="491" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-822" /></a></p>\n<p>The older-style <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/2011/12/19/version-2-0-android-blogging-re-imagined/">dashboard</a> user interface has been replaced with a Menu Drawer for quick and easy navigation to other areas of the app from wherever you are. You&#8217;ll find all of the same actions the dashboard had, but with the addition of some nifty new ones.</p>\n<p>To access the menu, simply tap the arrow next to the WordPress logo &#8211; in the top-left corner of the app &#8212; or swipe from the left side of the screen. If you&#8217;re on a large tablet device, the menu will always be visible, which takes advantage of the extra screen space. If you have multiple blogs in the app, you&#8217;ll see a drop-down list at the top of your Menu Drawer that you can access to quickly switch to another blog to work with, right in the app.</p>\n<p>When you leave the app, it will remember the last selection you made in the Menu Drawer so when you return, you can pick up where you left off.</p>\n<h3>Other new features</h3>\n<p>In addition to the revamped user interface, you&#8217;ll find these new features as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>View Site option</strong>. A <em>View Site</em> option has been added to the Menu Drawer so you can view your blogs from within the app.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Admin area access.</strong> You can access the wp-admin areas of your WordPress.com blogs by loading the <em>Dashboard</em> option in the Menu Drawer.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster loading.</strong> The WordPress.com Reader now takes advantage of caching for faster loading.</li>\n<li><strong>Updated look and feel.</strong> Settings have been converted to use the Android standard for preferences, giving them the Holo look and feel on supported devices. Many views have been updated to the Holo look and feel as well, including the post editor and all list views.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved post editor experience.</strong> The post editor now has an expandable content area, which makes it much easier to navigate around the post content when you&#8217;re editing.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved image uploading.</strong> If a post has an image but fails to upload the image, the post will be saved as a draft first &#8212; instead of published &#8212; so the image upload can be corrected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Thanks &#8212; and what&#8217;s next</h3>\n<p>We thank the developers who worked so hard on this release &#8211; <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/mrroundhill">mrroundhill</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/willnorris">willnorris</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/isaackeyet">isaackeyet</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/daniloercoli">daniloercoli</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/aerych">aerych</a> &#8211; as well as the beta testers who tried out the app over at the <a href="http://dev.android.wordpress.org">Developer Blog</a>. Great work, all!</p>\n<p>We also thank <a href="http://jakewharton.com/">Jake Wharton</a> and <a href="http://simonvt.net/">Simon Vig Therkildsen</a> for creating the ActionBarSherlock and android-menudrawer libraries that enabled us to use the Action Bar and Menu Drawer on older Android devices. Good stuff!</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s next? We&#8217;re looking at adding notifications to the app so you can keep up with what&#8217;s happening on your WordPress sites while mobile and on the go.</p>\n<p>What would you like to see added to the app?</p>\n<h3>Want to contribute?</h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget that WordPress for Android is an open source project.

I was afraid the accounts had been compromised and the passwords changed. I had secure passwords, but had been lazy about turning on 2-factor authentication for several of them &#8211; that&#8217;s all fixed now.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, the hiccup ended up being due to a Gmail disruption.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also turned on 2-factor authentication for this site using <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-authenticator/">this plugin</a> (make sure to enable the app key if you use iOS or Android apps to connect to your site). Note that the Social logins for commenting still work without 2-factor authentication.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d recommend taking similar steps for your sites. Waking up to an &#8220;uh-oh&#8221; feeling is no fun at all.</p>\n<p class="threads-post-notice">This post is part of the thread: <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/thread/passwords">Passwords</a> &#8211; an ongoing story on this site.

Right now there&#8217;s a botnet going around all of the WordPresses it can find trying to login with the &#8220;admin&#8221; username and a bunch of common passwords, and it has turned into a news story (especially from companies that sell &#8220;solutions&#8221; to the problem).</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I would recommend: If you still use &#8220;admin&#8221; as a username on your blog, <a href="http://www.digitalkonline.com/blog/change-your-wordpress-admin-username/">change it</a>, use a <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/selecting-a-strong-password/">strong password</a>, if you&#8217;re on WP.com <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/two-step-authentication/">turn on two-factor authentication</a>, and of course make sure you&#8217;re up-to-date on the latest version of WordPress. Do this and you&#8217;ll be ahead of 99% of sites out there and probably never have a problem. Most other advice isn&#8217;t great &#8212; supposedly this botnet has over 90,000 IP addresses, so an IP limiting or login throttling plugin isn&#8217;t going to be great (they could try from a different IP a second for 24 hours).</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 12 Apr 2013

the release of BuddyPress 1.7 just a few days ago, and with almost 1.5 million downloads behind us, I wanted to take the time to remind everyone about what&#8217;s gone into improving BuddyPress recently, and to reassure everyone that it&#8217;s okay to update.</p>\n<p>In the early days of BuddyPress, things were in flux. Andy and I were furiously building components and features, deprecating code, refactoring the way things worked, and generally tearing up the codebase over and over again. It helped us build a great foundation, but it made updating to the next version a scary and frustrating experience. To those that remember those days, I apologize; to everyone else, I&#8217;m sorry you missed out on the fun. <img src="http://buddypress.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>\n<p>Whenever your WordPress installation checks to see if BuddyPress needs an update, the WordPress.org Extend API remembers the current version of BuddyPress that you&#8217;re running. This is how we know (with relative accuracy) approximately how many of what versions are out in the wild, and it&#8217;s also how we generated the pinwheel below, taken from the Stats page from WordPress.org Extend:</p>\n<div id="attachment_161350" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-161350   " alt="Active BuddyPress Versions" src="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-11-at-3.18.43-PM.png" width="576" height="283" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Every color of the rainbow is clearly represented</p></div>\n<p>Despite the pretty colors, this pie chart is actually a little scary. There are so many old and outdated installations of BuddyPress out there, not taking advantage of the neat new features, and not running the most stable and secure code available. The irony is, this is largely our fault.</p>\n<p>These days, BuddyPress is a 1 click update in your WordPress dashboard, and we&#8217;ve built a bunch of API&#8217;s that allow third party plugin developers to write plugins that won&#8217;t break when BuddyPress needs an update. We&#8217;ve spent a large part of the past 2 years reinforcing the foundation we invested in, so that no one needs to be afraid to update BuddyPress ever again.</p>\n<p>Starting with BuddyPress 1.8, the core team will be focusing our efforts on including automated tests with each enhancement and critical bug fix, to help ensure that each future release gets more stable than the release before it. Boone Gorges and Paul Gibbs both donated huge amounts of labor building a test suite that is already committed into our development branch, just days after BuddyPress 1.7 was packaged up. Their dedication towards making BuddyPress stable and amazing for everyone is unwavering, and their contributions are truly awesome.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re running an old version of BuddyPress, I urge you to check out and update to BuddyPress 1.7. It&#8217;s the culmination of thousands of hours of effort, and is the most stable, secure, and performant version of BuddyPress yet. Help us change that pinwheel into more of a Pac-Man or a circle.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 21:02:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"John James Jacoby";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"Andrew Nacin: Keynoting php[tek] in Chicago, May 14-17";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"http://nacin.com/?p=4090";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"http://nacin.com/2013/04/11/tek13-php-conference-keynote/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3466:"<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce <strong>I&#8217;m giving a keynote address at <a href="http://tek.phparch.com/">php[tek] 2013</a></strong>.

If you have anything you think might help, please <a href="http://gravatar.com/nacin">contact me</a>. Here&#8217;s the full talk description:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<strong>WordPress is Everywhere: Extreme Portability as a Double-Edged Sword</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress has tens of millions of users worldwide and powers over a fifth of new sites. But such a large and diverse user base presents unique challenges, and as it approaches its tenth birthday, the WordPress codebase is showing its age. So why is it so ubiquitous?</p>\n<p>The answer lies not in its UI, UX, ecosystem, or community, though those are certainly among its strengths. The answer lies instead in a core philosophy that holds the user above all else.</p>\n<p>This user-centric design starts not with the interface, but rather with the code itself. Developers should approach software development with an unwavering promise they will deal with the nonsense instead of passing it off to the user.</p>\n<p>Some WordPress positions might seem draconian and inflexible. Backwards compatibility is almost never broken. The technical requirements appeal to lowest common denominators. But because the project maintainers deal with all the pain — technical debt, difficulties with PHP, working on as many server configurations (and misconfigurations) as possible — its users don’t have to. Thanks to the WordPress project’s portability efforts, you can pick a web host or a PHP configuration at random and WordPress will run on it.

Version 2.1 of WordPress for Windows Phone is out and adds some exciting new features.</p>\n<p>We’re happy to announce that you can now get comment push notifications on your Windows Phone (OS 7.5+) which enables you to moderate comments from wherever you happen to be at the time. With 2.1 you also get a rich text editor, making it much easier to write longer posts having to deal with any HTML code.</p>\n<p>Read on to learn what’s new or update/download version 2.1 from the Windows Phone Store right now by clicking below.</p>\n<p class="download"><a href="http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=5f64ad85-f801-e011-9264-00237de2db9e"><strong>Download App</strong>WordPress for Windows Phone</a><span class="download-info">Supported: WordPress.com or self-hosted WordPress (v. 2.9+)</span></p>\n<h3>Rich Text Editor</h3>\n<p>Now you finally have the ability to use a rich text editor when creating or editing a post or page. The new editor has easy to access styling options beneath the keyboard and in the app menu, these include bulleted/numbered lists, bold, underline, and italic text. You&#8217;ll also find a handy link helper among the text editing tools.</p>\n<h3>Comment Push Notifications</h3>\n<p>If you have a WordPress.com blog (or a self-hosted blog with the <a href="http://jetpack.me/">Jetpack plugin</a>) added to the app, you can now opt in to receive push notifications for new comments. This makes it easier than ever to keep up with your readers and moderate comments while on the go. You&#8217;ll get push notifications for new comments only and viewing a notification takes you right to the comment within the app. From there you can easily respond and moderate like usual.</p>\n<h3>Stability Improvements</h3>\n<p>In addition to the new features, we’ve worked hard on making the app even more stable. In total, almost <a href="http://windowsphone.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=Push+Notifications+and+Content+Editor" target="_blank">40 bugs and crashes</a> have been fixed in this release.</p>\n<h3>Screenshots</h3>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/version-2-1/#gallery-429-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\n<p>The following contributors have worked on this release of WordPress for Windows Phone:  <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/aerych">aerych</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/isaackeyet">isaackeyet</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/daniloercoli">daniloercoli</a>.</p>\n<h3>Get Involved!</h3>\n<p>We now have a feature-driven release cycle, meaning that updates will come faster and focus on single features and enhancements.

We&#8217;ll show off a few of our favorites below. Want to see a full changelog for 1.7? Check it out <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/releases/version-1-7/">on the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Theme Compatibility</em></p>\n<p>BuddyPress&#8217;s social features add new kinds of content to your WordPress site: groups, profiles, and so on. Until now, displaying that content has required building or finding a BP-compatible theme &#8211; one of the biggest hurdles to using BuddyPress. Version 1.7 makes this a thing of the past. Using a feature we call &#8220;theme compatibility&#8221;, BuddyPress can display its content within the context of any WordPress theme &#8211; no modifications required. Here are a few screenshots showing BP running on a few popular themes:</p>\n<p><div id="attachment_160342" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-twentytwelve.png"><img src="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-twentytwelve-150x150.png" alt="Twenty Twelve" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-160342" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Twenty Twelve</p></div> <div id="attachment_160343" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-coraline.png"><img src="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-coraline-150x150.png" alt="Coraline" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-160343" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Coraline</p></div> <div id="attachment_160344" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-superstore.png"><img src="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-superstore-150x150.png" alt="Woo Superstore" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-160344" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Woo Superstore</p></div></p>\n<div> </div>\n<p>Not satisfied with the way it looks out of the box? Not a problem. BuddyPress still provides a sophisticated, modular templating system, which you can easily customize in your own theme. Theme developers and designers can learn much more about theme compat on <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/theme-development/a-quick-look-at-1-7-theme-compatibility/">the BuddyPress codex</a>.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<p><em>Group Administration</em></p>\n<div id="attachment_160321" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/dashboard.png"><img src="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/dashboard-300x216.png" alt="Group Administration in BuddyPress 1.7" width="150" class="size-medium wp-image-160321" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Group Administration in BP 1.7</p></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve run a BuddyPress-powered community site, you know that groups are a powerful way for members to connect. But there&#8217;s been no way for site administrators to manage groups. BP 1.7 introduces a brand new set of Group Administration panels on your WordPress Dashboard. Now BP admins can bulk-delete groups, edit group settings, and manage group membership without ever leaving wp-admin.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<p><em>A Better Installation Experience</em></p>\n<div id="attachment_160328" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/about.png"><img src="http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/about-150x150.png" alt="About Screen" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-160328" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">About Screen</p></div>\n<p>BuddyPress makes it easy to add social features to your site, and BP 1.7 streamlines the process more than ever. We&#8217;ve removed the installation wizard in favor of a totally automated setup &#8211; just hit Activate, and we&#8217;ll handle the rest. On new installations, only the Activity and Extended Profiles components are activated, helping you to start small and grow your community features bit by bit. And, following in WordPress&#8217;s footsteps, we&#8217;ve added About and Credits screens, helping you to get up to date on the BuddyPress project.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<h3>Springtime Goodies</h3>\n<p>BuddyPress 1.7 is codenamed &#8220;Totonno&#8221;, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totonno%27s">the legendary Brooklyn pizza joint</a>. Totonno&#8217;s is just a few blocks from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island_Cyclone">the Cyclone</a> and the Coney Island boardwalk, and there&#8217;s no better end to a lovely spring day than to indulge in what may be the world&#8217;s greatest pepperoni pie. With spring finally coming to Brooklyn, we think it&#8217;s appropriate to honor a pizza institution with what we think will be a watershed BuddyPress release.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<h3>The BuddyPress Community Rocks</h3>\n<p>Hundreds of developers, designers, and community volunteers have put thousands of hours into this version of BuddyPress. When you use BP, you&#8217;re standing on their shoulders.

For the first installment, check out the new <code>shortcode_atts_{$shortcode}</code> filter. The <code>shortcode_atts()</code> function now accepts a third parameter — the name of the shortcode — which enables the running of this filter. All of the core shortcodes now pass this parameter.</p>\n<p>This filter passes three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>$out</code> — the output array of shortcode attributes</li>\n<li><code>$pairs</code> — the array of accepted parameters and their defaults.</li>\n<li><code>$atts</code> — the input array of shortcode attributes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at what we can do with this. One thing is that you can dynamically set or override shortcode values. You an also define new ones, and transpose them into accepted ones. Let&#8217;s look at the &#8220;gallery&#8221; shortcode for example. What if there was a gallery of images that you would reuse. Instead of picking the images each time, you could have a plugin that gives that set of attachment IDs a shortcut name. Then you could do <code>[gallery foo=my-gallery-name]</code>, which the plugin would convert to a list of IDs. Or, you could enforce a certain number of gallery columns on the fly. Let someone set it theme-wide, without having them go back and change their shortcodes.</p>\n<p>What other uses can you think of?</p>\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;re a plugin or theme author who provides their own shortcodes, you should immediately start providing this third parameter to your <code>shortcode_atts()</code> calls (since it is an extra parameter, you can do this without a WordPress version check). Maybe it&#8217;ll reduce the number of times people need to fork your code just to add an option to your shortcode!</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3975/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3975/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=3975&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 05 Apr 2013 03:12:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.6 Beta 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2547";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-3-6-beta-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4076:"<p>WordPress 3.6 Beta 1 is now available!</p>\n<p>This is software still in development and <strong>we <em>really</em> don’t recommend that you run it on a production site</strong> — set up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 3.6, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”).

Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave: </strong> Posts are now autosaved locally. If your browser crashes, your computer dies, or the server goes offline as you&#8217;re saving, you won&#8217;t lose the your post.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking: </strong> See when someone is currently editing a post, and kick them out of it if they fall asleep at the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Nav Menus: </strong> Nav menus have been simplified with an accordion-based UI, and a separate tab for  bulk-assigning menus to locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Revisions:</strong> The all-new revisions UI features avatars, a slider that &#8220;scrubs&#8221; through history, and two-slider range comparisons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Developers: </strong> You make WordPress awesome(er). One of the things we strive to do with every release is be compatible with existing plugins and themes.

many of the present readers might know me very well, and that in part, is the reason that I have made the decision to transfer WLTC to more willing and presently capable hands. I am a stranger on my blog and the time has come for me to make sure that this blog, its contents and its knowledge are archived and preserved and maybe rejuvenated at a later time.</p>\n<p>I delved into blogging tools back in 2004 when I started my Masters degree in CS. I wanted some code to mess around with in my free time and everyone was talking about blogging. I looked into a variety of tools, built a small Linux server for myself at home, and installed a few of the tools that were freely available at that time. I had a heck of a time getting a hold of MT (Moveable Type, the most well-known name) and then found b2 by sheer luck. I loved the cool look of Michael&#8217;s blog and the people involved in the tool seemed to be open to comments and replied warmly to my emails and questions. Through the b2 forums I heard about WordPress and proceeded to install it on my own. To my astonishment, it worked without a hitch and I was blogging away in no time. I started looking through the code to understand how it worked and it drew me in every step of the way.</p>\n<p>Within a few months of installing WordPress, I started to take part in the forums and wrote a few plugins and created some &#8220;hacks&#8221; for the tool. I even gained some notoriety with my MT VS WP post and that&#8217;s when the WordPress ecosphere started to look very attractive to me. I did not do this to seek attention, but I was getting a lot of attention and I was loving it. I believe that was when Matt first noticed me and we exchanged some emails and chatted with each other. With every month and with every release of WordPress I was getting more involved. At some point I realized that I could not do it alone and hired a few interested people to help me write posts and the blog started to get popular. I brought on some advertisers to help me offset costs. Matt gave me and my blog the highest honor of being included in the WordPress Planet and that&#8217;s when things really started to happen for this blog. I also started a WordPress Job blog (http://jobs.wordpress.net) which I still curate and I got involved in WordPress evangelism. Somewhere within this time, Matt had asked me to work for him at the new company he was starting and I had to turn him down because of visa restrictions and because I wanted to finish school (I kick myself every time I think about that).</p>\n<p>WordPress started to mature and WordCamps started to happen. I graduated from school with a Master&#8217;s Degree in Computer Science and found a job. I wanted to stay involved but it was getting bigger than I could handle. I could either dive in and get into WordPress and the blogging world, or I could focus on my job, career and family. I decided to choose the latter. I still wanted to loosely be involved with WordPress and things went well for a couple of years with me being casually involved. I even visited and spoke at a couple of WordCamps.</p>\n<p>When my son Lucien was born, all my time and attention was exhausted on him. I could not spend any time with WordPress or blogging at all. In addition to my growing family, I was diagnosed with a serious health condition just as I was starting a new job and moving to a new city. Needless to say, the blog was the last thing on my mind. James, who has been the sole author and curator for a long time, was my winning hand and just a fantastic helper and well wisher. He has kept things running for a long time and I have had no complaints.</p>\n<p>But I have found very little time to come back and spend with my old friends, Weblog Tools Collection and WordPress. I do not want this blog&#8217;s content and conversations to be lost or forgotten because of my neglect. I am hoping this move will help it live on as an archive, or find new lifeblood in another form. I know that it is in the right hands.</p>\n<p>So Adios and Gracias. I hope to see you in another blog, and take part in another conversation with you someday. It has been a wonderful journey and I appreciate everything that has taken place because of WordPress and every bit of help and encouragement that has been provided to me by so many of you. So thank to my wonderful audience of many years, thanks to my advertisers, thanks to my authors and finally thanks to Matt and to WordPress for making my life so much more fulfilling and successful.</p>\n<p>Peace on Earth, Goodwill to All, And to All a Goodnight!</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/NRKA8GMV-fA" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 31 Mar 2013 13:41:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Mark Ghosh";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"Weblog Tools Collection: Where to Find WordPress News";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12846";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/ah3QRPNnlhs/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2837:"<p>The landscape of news has changed so much over the last few years that news about a particular topic or platform is readily available to anyone within an instant. With <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, I imagine that could be one of the perks of <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2012/08/08/the-state-of-the-word-in-2012/">powering over 16% of the web</a>, but it&#8217;s true that news is becoming incredibly accessible. In short, news is everywhere.</p>\n<p>Speaking of WordPress in general, you can of course acquire official direct news from <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/">WordPress News</a>, but you can also take a peak behind the curtain and follow news in the making at <a href="http://make.wordpress.org">Make WordPress.org</a>. Though it&#8217;s only specific to the <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a> blogging platform, <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com">WordPress.com News</a> is also worth watching for WordPress development news, as WordPress.com users often get access to new WordPress features before they&#8217;re released, so you&#8217;ll be able to try new features rather than just read about them.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s more news than just direct official news, like I said earlier, it&#8217;s everywhere. You could subscribe to every general news site, every core developer&#8217;s personal blog, every premium theme shop, and every plugin developer, but why not subscribe to a few curated news sources instead? I guess you could call <a href="http://planet.wordpress.org">WordPress Planet</a> the official curated news source, but it&#8217;s really just a collection of all news items from a particular set of curated blogs. For specific news items curated from sources through the entire WordPress community, subscribe to <a href="http://poststat.us">Post Status</a>, and don&#8217;t neglect the power of allowing the folks you follow on <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://plus.google.com">Google+</a>, and/or <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> to curate news for you.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the WordPress community, you should <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress">get involved</a> if you aren&#8217;t already.

Please try it, either on a test site, or wherever you feel comfortable running it, and <a href="http://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/">let us know if you run into any issues</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 19:47:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"John James Jacoby";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"Matt: Imports Keep Rolling, and Trust";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=42335";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"http://ma.tt/2013/03/imports-and-trust/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:900:"<p>TechCrunch writes <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/wordpress-com-has-imported-15m-posts-in-the-last-30-days-remains-a-top-safe-haven-for-nomad-bloggers/">WordPress.com Has Imported 15M Posts In The Last 30 Days, Remains A Top Safe Haven For Nomad Bloggers</a>.

href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?ls=1&mt=8">App Store</a>. The dev team focused on the content editor for this release, which adds some very handy new features:</p>\n<h3>Draft previews</h3>\n<p>We know that publishing your very best stuff is important, and you should be able to see what your post or page will look like <em>before</em> you publish. Now, in version 3.5 of WordPress for iOS, you can preview your drafts! Just tap the preview &#8220;eye&#8221; tab while drafting your post or page to see the post as it will appear on your WordPress site after you hit publish.</p>\n<p>If you have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive</a> WordPress theme the preview will show what your post looks like on a mobile device.</p>\n<h3>Autosave</h3>\n<p>Thanks to a new Autosave feature, your site&#8217;s content is safer than ever before. Now, when you edit a draft in the app, you&#8217;ll notice a small &#8220;Autosaved ✓&#8221; message appear as you type. The draft is instantly saved locally, and if you have a reliable Internet connection at the time, it will autosave online to your WordPress site, too.</p>\n<p><img src="http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wpios-3-5-autosave1.jpg?w=420&h=188" alt="Version 3.5 of WordPress for iOS: Autosave" width="420" height="188" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1395" /></p>\n<h3>More improvements and bug fixes</h3>\n<p>This release also includes improvements for WordPress.com and Jetpack notifications, as well as fixes for crashes and other bugs. You can check out all the changes <a href="http://ios.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=02%2F11%2F13&daysback=6&authors=&ticket=on&milestone=on&changeset=on&wiki=on&update=Update">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The crash on launch that some of you were seeing has been fixed in this release.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>\n<p>We want to continue making your mobile blogging experience better and better! While the dev team is currently deciding what to work on for version 3.6, these next items are high on our list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rich Text Editor</li>\n<li>Improved media management</li>\n<li>Sharing to the app from third-party apps and services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to keep up with the latest happenings in the WordPress mobile world?

Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave: </strong> Posts are now autosaved locally. If your browser crashes, your computer dies, or the server goes offline as you&#8217;re saving, you won&#8217;t lose the your post.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking: </strong> See when someone is currently editing a post, and kick them out of it if they fall asleep at the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Nav Menus: </strong> Nav menus have been simplified with an accordion-based UI, and a separate tab for  bulk-assigning menus to locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Revisions:</strong> The all-new revisions UI features avatars, a slider that &#8220;scrubs&#8221; through history, and two-slider range comparisons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Developers: </strong> You make WordPress awesome(er). One of the things we strive to do with every release is be compatible with existing plugins and themes. But we need your help. <strong>Please test your plugins and themes against 3.6.</strong> If something isn&#8217;t quite right, please let us know. (Chances are, it wasn&#8217;t intentional.)

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/">3.4</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="http://webos.wordpress.org/">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">core</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">forum support</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/updates/">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href="http://sopastrike.com/numbers/">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans. If you didn&#8217;t make it to a WordCamp this year, maybe it can be one of your new year resolutions: <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/">check the schedule</a> to find one near you!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/2012-a-look-back/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"WordPress 3.5 “Elvin”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:54:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2517";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:363:"It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year: a new WordPress release is available and chock-full of goodies to delight bloggers and developers alike.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="692" height="388" title="Introducing WordPress 3.5" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

However they have not always operated in the impressive way they do at present.</p>\n<p>Before I started in my role they were known as the PAU (Performing Arts Union) and were supported by SUSU through the Societies Officer and the VP Welfare &amp; Societies, it won&#8217;t surprise you to hear that they didn&#8217;t get that much time or attention!</p>\n<p>Before 2010 the majority of the current PA societies existed, however under PAU ironically they were not very united. They operated as 30 individual groups that occasionally collaborated. Hence when the creation of the Performing Arts Student Leader and VP Student Engagement they were pretty happy and the future looked a bit more optimistic.</p>\n<p>In November 2011 Peewee, Sam Ling and I organised an <a title="Back to the Future" href="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2011/11/14/back-to-the-future/">Open Space Technology Conference</a> where members from all societies were asked one simple question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: center">How do we make Performing Arts the Next Big Thing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>9 &#8211; The Next Big Thing</h3>\n<p>Since then Performing Arts have gone from strength to strength, the merit of just getting the groups together and discussing their individual issues was amazing. Everyone realising that they had similar barriers to excellence and that collectively they were stronger as one was personally impressive.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px" alt="" src="http://theatre.susu.org/images/resources/graphics/pa.png" width="245" height="174" />Over the last twelve months Performing Arts has become a united force to be reckoned with within the university community by developing their new identity and brand, working together to solve problems and using their collective weight to get more support from SUSU and the University.</p>\n<p>In addition to enabling the groups to work together, the session created a lot of feedback on how to solve our problem.</p>\n<p>Performing Arts Committee have then taken this to the next level by creating a Strategic Plan to 2015, which links in with SUSU&#8217;s overall strategy the <a href="http://www.susu.org/downloads/union-plan-2015.pdf" target="_blank">Union Plan.</a></p>\n<p>The Strategy is still in draft format and this is where you come in, <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8U9Ft_afuNeM2JyaHo1S2NEb0U/edit" target="_blank">check it out here</a>, and let us know what you think in the comments below.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt one of the top successes across my tenure has to be #NextBigThing and Performing Arts.</p>\n<p>Smurph

But for these many years the activities room has never been changed&#8230; mainly because mirrors and flooring in that one room are not the solution to the problem!</p>\n<p>SUSUPA Dance do three things essentially Practice, Compete and Perform. And for all three of those things the flooring we had was not suitable:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">1. <strong>Practice</strong> &#8211; we have the MPS Dance Studio which is ideal for dance classes/practice but you don&#8217;t need a protractor to work out that theres not enough hours in the evening to satisfy all of the dance societies requirements.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">2. <strong>Competitions</strong> &#8211; SUSUPA Dance have been looking to host a dance competition for over two years now and one of the barriers they are facing is the lack of a flooring to host competitions on.</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px">3. <strong>Perform</strong> &#8211; Like all PA groups dancers like to show off there talents, and they do it in such an epic way, Pure Dance. This is defo on my recommended list of things to do during your time at uni. (Having said that most PA shows are wicked, and im gutted I didn&#8217;t get myself along to some of them earlier!). For Pure Dance the groups have to hire in a flooring at quite a considerable price!</p>\n<h3>6 &#8211; Portable Dance Flooring!</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 0px" alt="" src="http://customerunderground.com/sites/default/files/icon/story/dino.jpg" width="304" height="350" />So this summer SUSU have bought portable flooring that can be used in a variety of locations allowing us to enable more people to become dancing dinosaurs. We can set up the activities room to allow smaller classes or squads to pracise, we can set it up in the cube to allow us to host Southamptons first ever dance competition! and we can set up in the turner simms to save money on show costs for pure dance!</p>\n<p>If you recon your Club or Society might want to use this flooring you can book it alongside a room by using the SUSU Room Booking System and including it as a note in your booking <img src=''http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' />  . We also have portable mirrors on there way to a room bookings system near you soon.</p>\n<p>Check out how the dance presidents reacted when they first found the flooring in SUSU&#8230;</p>\n<iframe

This year was no exception was no exception, 1000s of you braved the weather to come and see the vast amount of activities  have at SUSU to join in with.</p>\n<p>On top of our usual bunfight we had a guide to explain to you what the order of the stalls would be (as per Jade&#8217;s Manifesto) so you new what to expect as you walked around, and also launched our mobile get involved site <a href="www.susu.org/getinvolved" target="_blank">www.susu.org/getinvolved </a> where you can register your interest in Student Groups giving them the ability to email you about their group.This was ideal for those who couldn&#8217;t attend the bunfight, or happened to miss the stall they were after in the hustle and bustle!</p>\n<p>On top of this Jade (Societies Officer) worked with her team to produce a<a href="https://bunfight.soton.me/" target="_blank"> virtual bunfight</a> where you could go on and see all of the societies stalls!</p>\n<p>Essentially for our first day of  12 Christmas Engagement Stories we stepped up the bunfight to being more than just a day but also an online platform to make our student groups much more accesible to you. Check out <a

Its better to diversify and concentrate on what they are good at, suggestion to have an undergrad rep on their committee.</p>\n<p>15:51 &#8211; Reasonable discussion with committee about BioSoc overlap, however there is a clear need for this society and there are people keen to run it.</p>\n<p>15:52 &#8211; Biological Sciences Postgraduate Society ( BSPS) &#8211; <strong>Affiliated</strong></p>\n<p>15:55 &#8211; CookCook Society &#8211; Two members who are presenting an idea about a society which teaches people how to cook quick healthy meals in a fun process.

It also means that different student groups and committees can work together better because they&#8217;ll be meeting together within their zones.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left">2) Rather than just having a one-size fits all approach to our committees, we&#8217;ve split them up into two &#8211; <strong>policy zones</strong> and <strong>activity zones</strong>. 3 zones are on the left-hand-side because they are mainly there to set policy and values that ALL the committees of the Union can live by e.g. Ethical and Environmental committee making sure that the whole Union is being ethical in its activity / International committee making sure that all the activity zones are inclusive for International students. 5 zones are on the right-hand-side because they do a certain activity, and so can make real and direct change for students. However, it isn&#8217;t a complete split &#8211; policy zones can still run events (activities) and activity zones can still set policy (it&#8217;s just more likely to be policy about their specific zone).</p>\n<p style="text-align: left">3) We should put the &#8216;small bubbles&#8217; together based on <em>what they do</em>; rather than just where they fit now. This means that we have a few different groupings than we do at the moment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Student Communities zone is formed based around cohorts of students that are pre-determined i.e. once you get here, you&#8217;re either in them or you&#8217;re not &#8211; you can&#8217;t choose to be an international student. This would include Sites, and also, interestingly, JCRs &#8211; here&#8217;s the thinking: JCRs are here to represent a group of students, they are not here to do a certain activity. Hence why they fit within this policy zone, rather than an activity zone (e.g. student engagement).</li>\n<li>Societies are supported based around what they do, rather than being lumped together in one place. International and cultural societies would be represented and supported within the Student Communities zone&#8230; Sports societies would be supported within the Sports Development zone. However, there would still be a central place that supports societies in terms of their affiliations, constitutions and elections, and this would sit within the democracy zone (because all that stuff already happens there on a SUSU-wide scale). This means that there is still a central place for our student groups, which can now run better, but also that societies get to be part of the relevant conversations around SUSU, rather than just having to hear what other societies are doing.</li>\n<li>Union Films, Performing Arts, Media Departments and music, arts and media societies would come together to form a &#8216;Creative Industries&#8217; Zone. These groups, do 2 things that are the same&#8230; Not only are they fun activities to get involved with, which are enriching for students&#8230; but they also produce content for the entire student body. SUSUtv don&#8217;t just get students involved in making television, they also create shows that any student can watch; like Performing Arts who put on their shows; like Union Films, who don&#8217;t just give students a chance to run a cinema, but also give students a chance to come and watch films right here in SUSU.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any thoughts about the review so far, then you can

Registering Interest with Clubs/Societies -</strong></h4>\n<p>Couldn’t make it to the Bunfight? In all the craziness you missed that one group you were looking for? Want to sign up for something at a different time of year?</p>\n<p>This summer we have developed a new part of our website (that works nicely on smart phones) <a href="http://www.susu.org/getinvolved" target="_blank">www.susu.org/GetInvolved</a>. Once you are logged into SUSU.org this page allows you to look at <strong>all of the things that you can get involved during your time</strong> at the University of Southampton. Then when people have expressed all of their interests the Groups can log into the website and contact you directly, saving you from having to sign up at all the stalls.</p>\n<h4><strong>2. Up to Date Contact Details -</strong></h4>\n<p>You&#8217;ve finally found the group for you and you click on their website, its out of date, their facebook brings you to the 2009 freshers page, and their email just doesnt work&#8230;. Pretty annoying.</p>\n<p>This summer we have developed a system where by the Student Groups can log in and keep their own information up to date, meaning you will always be able to see the correct links when looking at the <a href="http://www.susu.org/something-for-everyone/2012/" target="_blank">Something for Everyone Tab</a>.</p>\n<div id="attachment_5224" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 192px"><a href="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2012/10/04/how-can-i-do-what-i-love/481288001_bored_xlarge/" rel="attachment wp-att-5224"><img class=" wp-image-5224   " style="border: 0px" src="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/files/2012/10/481288001_bored_xlarge.jpeg" alt="" width="182" height="202" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">These bored freshers just keep getting younger&#8230;</p></div>\n<h4> <strong>3. Finding out What&#8217;s On - </strong></h4>\n<p><strong></strong>You&#8217;re so bored of work but all of the groups you&#8217;ve signed up for have nothing on this week&#8230; You want to go do something but you have no idea of whats going on&#8230;.</p>\n<p>SUSU Groups, Sports Clubs and Societies can now <strong>add their own events </strong>to the SUSU What&#8217;s On Calendar. You will now be able to goto the <a href="http://www.susu.org/calendar/" target="_blank">What&#8217;s on Tab</a> on SUSU.org for all of the things going on in the University community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>4. Joining Clubs/Societies &#8211;  </strong></h4>\n<p>You really like this club but always forget to bring cash to the sessions. You want to join this society and have money left to spend on your <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/entitlement/" target="_blank">Student Entitlement Card</a>.</p>\n<p>This year, Sports Clubs &amp; Societies were given the option to sell their membership through the SUSU Box Office, meaning that you can join their group at any time online at <a href="http://boxoffice.susu.org/" target="_blank">the box office site</a> or in person at the SUSU Reception (8am-8pm) in Building 42. Check out what groups are available for purchase <a href="http://boxoffice.susu.org/view/322/group-membership" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>So what&#8217;s next?</h4>\n<p>These are the main ways we have been working to make life easier for you when it comes to all of the opportunities to find something you love within SUSU.

The show was based on<strong> three siblings who come together at the wake of their estranged father&#8217;s funeral where wine flows and social etiquette goes to pot </strong>which was declared<strong> “</strong>a little gem of a show” and containing “great British humour”.</p>\n<p><a href="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2012/09/16/fanatical-about-fringe/gr/" rel="attachment wp-att-4984"><img class="wp-image-4984 alignleft" style="border: 0px currentColor" src="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/files/2012/09/gr-540x396.png" alt="" width="292" height="214" /></a>As well as showstoppers’ original musical <strong>Theatre Group</strong> returned to the Fringe and took up an original British Gangster comedy, Ruthlessness.<strong> </strong><strong>Set after the 1997 New Labour election victory, Ruthlessness told the tale of a sordid assortment of mobsters, corrupt politicians and bent sports organisers. Following the death of mob boss Daddy Carlyle, his son takes control of his criminal empire and sets his sights on controlling a local politician, by rigging the up and coming title bout for the featherweight championship of the world.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRGu9W3J1o0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRGu9W3J1o0</a></strong></p>\n<h4>Festival go-ers often perform for the satisfaction, knowing that it is highly unlikely to turn a profit; with 2,695 shows from 47 countries in 279 venues a big audience is never expected. However, Theatre Group and Showstoppers went above and beyond all expectations, with an audience never below 10 for both shows.</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each show received<strong> 4* reviews</strong> (you can read them <a href="http://one4review.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/good-grief/">here </a>and <a href="http://www.threeweeks.co.uk/?s=Ruthlessness">here</a>) and Good Grief also recieved nominations for <strong>Best Music</strong>, <strong>Best Lyrics</strong> and <strong>Best New Musical</strong> at the National Musical Theatre Awards. On top of all this success Good Grief were approached by a University group who wanted to perform the show during their freshers’ week and publishers who were interested in the show being turned into a full length piece!</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in auditioning for the Fringe, or joining the Perfroming Arts in general, check out the Performing Arts tent and stage at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/340098412740831/">bunfight</a>, follow us on twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/susuperform">@SUSUPerform</a>, or check out the <a href="http://perform.susu.org">Performing Arts website.</a></p>\n<h4>The question posed now is is should all Performing Arts societies perform under the Gone Rogue Productions banner when they go on tour? This would range from the Light Opera performing at the Gilbert and Sullivan festival to music tours that happen in Europe. Should SUSU start its own Performing Arts Company?  What do you think?</h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4990" style="border: 0px

It also means that different student groups and committees can work together better because they&#8217;ll be meeting together within their zones.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left">2) Rather than just having a one-size fits all approach to our committees, we&#8217;ve split them up into two &#8211; <strong>policy zones</strong> and <strong>activity zones</strong>. 3 zones are on the left-hand-side because they are mainly there to set policy and values that ALL the committees of the Union can live by e.g. Ethical and Environmental committee making sure that the whole Union is being ethical in its activity / International committee making sure that all the activity zones are inclusive for International students. 5 zones are on the right-hand-side because they do a certain activity, and so can make real and direct change for students. However, it isn&#8217;t a complete split &#8211; policy zones can still run events (activities) and activity zones can still set policy (it&#8217;s just more likely to be policy about their specific zone).</p>\n<p style="text-align: left">3) We should put the &#8216;small bubbles&#8217; together based on <em>what they do</em>; rather than just where they fit now. This means that we have a few different groupings than we do at the moment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Student Communities zone is formed based around cohorts of students that are pre-determined i.e. once you get here, you&#8217;re either in them or you&#8217;re not &#8211; you can&#8217;t choose to be an international student. This would include Sites, and also, interestingly, JCRs &#8211; here&#8217;s the thinking: JCRs are here to represent a group of students, they are not here to do a certain activity. Hence why they fit within this policy zone, rather than an activity zone (e.g. student engagement).</li>\n<li>Societies are supported based around what they do, rather than being lumped together in one place. International and cultural societies would be represented and supported within the Student Communities zone&#8230; Sports societies would be supported within the Sports Development zone. However, there would still be a central place that supports societies in terms of their affiliations, constitutions and elections, and this would sit within the democracy zone (because all that stuff already happens there on a SUSU-wide scale). This means that there is still a central place for our student groups, which can now run better, but also that societies get to be part of the relevant conversations around SUSU, rather than just having to hear what other societies are doing.</li>\n<li>Union Films, Performing Arts, Media Departments and music, arts and media societies would come together to form a &#8216;Creative Industries&#8217; Zone. These groups, do 2 things that are the same&#8230; Not only are they fun activities to get involved with, which are enriching for students&#8230; but they also produce content for the entire student body. SUSUtv don&#8217;t just get students involved in making television, they also create shows that any student can watch; like Performing Arts who put on their shows; like Union Films, who don&#8217;t just give students a chance to run a cinema, but also give students a chance to come and watch films right here in SUSU.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any thoughts about the review so far, then you can either comment them below and/OR come along to an open session that we&#8217;re running this Thursday at Meeting Room 2 at 12pm!</p>\n<p>Democracy Love</p>\n<p>Davey G</p>\n<p>P.S. for those of you who are wondering &#8211; I asked what I should call this blog on Facebook, and this was the most popular choice&#8230;</p>\n', 'Hi!

We have each narrowed our goals down to three areas and across the next couple of weeks are looking to gauge your feedback so essentially you, the student body, can direct our work.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left">So here are my three&#8230;</p>\n<h4>1. Streamlined Support for Student Groups.<a href="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2012/08/09/one-to-go/funny-facebook-fails-failbook-support-those-tears-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4699"><img class="wp-image-4699 alignleft" style="border: 0px currentColor" src="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/files/2012/08/funny-facebook-fails-failbook-support-those-tears1-e1344532592611.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="202" /></a></h4>\n<p>As you may know my role was new as of the begining of last year and encompasses a lot of aspects of the union which SUSU hasn&#8217;t always been the best at supporting. I want to ensure that each of the volunteer led areas that I look after have <strong>the correct support, systems and processes in place,</strong> in order to enable these groups to thrive.</p>\n<p>Some examples of projects that will feed into this goal are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing the RAG website to display monthly totals for RAG and RAG Challenge Groups.</li>\n<li>Allowing Societies to add events to the SUSU Whats On Calandar.</li>\n<li>Developing &#8216;The Directory&#8217;, an online deal brouchure for Student Groups.</li>\n<li>All forms online for student groups!</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. Developing Student Involvement.<a href="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2012/08/09/one-to-go/27978_10150187098330026_1627532_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-4702"><img class="wp-image-4702 alignright" style="border: 0px currentColor" src="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/files/2012/08/27978_10150187098330026_1627532_n-e1344532900686.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="314" /></a></h4>\n<p>Getting students involved in SUSU and making sure that we look at the ways that students engage is vital to a successful Students&#8217; Union. Across the year I want to work on a number of initiatives in order to <strong>establish our engagement levels</strong>, <strong>define our opportunities</strong> and d<strong>evelop our methods for getting students involved</strong>.</p>\n<p>This may include working on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A &#8216;Get Involved&#8217; online site and App.</li>\n<li>Campaigns within halls of residence.</li>\n<li>Working on the development of SUSUs Engagement Strategy as well as looking at the recent AGM Policy.</li>\n<li>Developing Societies in Winchester surrounding students interests.</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Student Group Affiliations</h4>\n<p>Currently SUSU affiliates over 160 Societies and 76 Sports Clubs and we currently adopt a one size fits all approach to how we interact with these groups. I want to work with Dean on a project that examines this relationship and looks forward to how we can <strong>best suit our members needs within clubs and societies</strong>.</p>\n<p>This will mainly be looking at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protecting SUSU and the Student Groups.</li>\n<li>Developing Resources, Training and Codes of Practice for Student Groups.</li>\n<li>Looking at different shapes and sizes of groups and how we interact with them.</li>\n<li>How we allocate budgets, grants and resources.</li>\n<li>etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may notice each section is finished with an etc, this is because these plans are not set in stone and are infact a very early version of what I intend to bring to council!

A classic example of this is within the Dance societies where they not only <a href="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2012/03/19/dancing-our-way-to-success/" >smashed it in dance competitions </a>throughout the year but also sold out a collaborative Pure Dance Show!

Over the past year I have been working with the Residences team within Student Services to inact a plan to finally address this issue.</p>\n<p>Last autumn, we conducted an <strong>audit of all common room space </strong>and also consulted both <strong>students living in halls </strong>and <strong>ex-residents</strong> about what they want from the halls experience. This has fed into a report that has steered the universities view on what common spaces should provide for students within halls. To date SUSU is working on a joint project with the University to develop a rolling program for common room spaces with <strong>one space to be finished in time for freshers!</strong></p>\n<h4><a href="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2012/08/08/?attachment_id=4660" rel="attachment wp-att-4660"><img class="alignright  wp-image-4660" style="border: 0pt none" src="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2012/08/08/files/2012/08/561101_10150756673270605_704700604_11886199_962355532_n-349x540.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="324" /></a></h4>\n<p><strong>Supporting the Growth of RAG:</strong></p>\n<p>The past year has seen a dramatic change in how SUSU approaches RAG and how we support students to build skills whilst fundraising. We have endavoured to make RAG less about a small group of people fundraising and more about the concept <strong>any time a University of Southampton Student raises money for Charity they are contributing to RAG. </strong> With this in mind we have developed how other student groups can measure and record their achievements through fundraising, we call this <strong>Your RAG Challenge. </strong></p>\n<p>Over the year we have changed the structure of the committee creating Team leaders and more oppertunities for students to get involved in fundraising through RAG. We brought back <strong>RAG Week</strong> our fundraising week and allowed students to <a href="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2012/06/19/choose-your-charity/" ><strong>Nominate and Vote</strong></a> for  the three main RAG Charities online.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow I will be hitting you up with <strong>One to Go</strong> and introducing my thoughts on where my prorities may lie next year.</p>\n', 'One Down…', 'This is part one of a two blog blockbuster: One Down : Looking at how last years goals panned out in the world of Engagement.

We provided them with training, many-an inspirational speech, and the opportunity to develop their ideas with their sabbatical leaders.</p>\n<p>One area we worked on is equality and diversity within SUSU. This is an integral part of our union and something we should all be scratching our chins a wee bit more about. It&#8217;s crucial that we challenge tired stereotypes; university should be a safe space where everyone is treated with respect and dignity and where oppressive language and derogatory behaviour is absolutely not tolerated. It&#8217;s 2012: it&#8217;s time to get wise to equality, folks. So here are just a few things your Student Leaders said they&#8217;re going to do, to make SUSU an inclusive and fair environment for all.

They operated as 30 individual groups that occasionally collaborated. Hence when the creation of the Performing Arts Student Leader and VP Student Engagement they were pretty happy and the future looked a bit more optimistic.</p>\n<p>In November 2011 Peewee, Sam Ling and I organised an <a title="Back to the Future" href="http://blogs.susu.org/sabbs/2011/11/14/back-to-the-future/">Open Space Technology Conference</a> where members from all societies were asked one simple question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style="text-align: center">How do we make Performing Arts the Next Big Thing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>9 &#8211; The Next Big Thing</h3>\n<p>Since then Performing Arts have gone from strength to strength, the merit of just getting the groups together and discussing their individual issues was amazing. Everyone realising that they had similar barriers to excellence and that collectively they were stronger as one was personally impressive.</p>\n<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px" alt="" src="http://theatre.susu.org/images/resources/graphics/pa.png" width="245" height="174" />Over the last twelve months Performing Arts has become a united force to be reckoned with within the university community by developing their new identity and brand, working together to solve problems and using their collective weight to get more support from SUSU and the University.</p>\n<p>In addition to enabling the groups to work together, the session created a lot of feedback on how to solve our problem.</p>\n<p>Performing Arts Committee have then taken this to the next level by creating a Strategic Plan to 2015, which links in with SUSU&#8217;s overall strategy the <a href="http://www.susu.org/downloads/union-plan-2015.pdf" >Union Plan.</a></p>\n<p>The Strategy is still in draft format and this is where you come in, <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8U9Ft_afuNeM2JyaHo1S2NEb0U/edit" >check it out here</a>, and let us know what you think in the comments below.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt one of the top successes across my tenure has to be #NextBigThing and Performing Arts.</p>\n<p>Smurph x</p>\n', '#Engage12 – P-P-Pick up a Performing Arts!', 'I think its fair to say that Performing Arts within the University of&nbsp;Southampton&nbsp;have been knocking about for a long time.
